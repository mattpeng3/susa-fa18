I bought a bottle of 10,000 IU and took a dose, but ended up having an anxiety attack two hours later, which took me a week to get over. I did some research and found that most vitamin D side effects are a sign of magnesium deficiency, so I bought some high quality magnesium and lowered my vitamin D dose to 2,000 IU. I tried again, but had the same mental side effects. Does anyone have any idea what’s going on?

Currently I have:<lb><lb>Precision Attack<lb><lb>Menacing Attack<lb><lb>Pushing Attack<lb><lb>and I have no idea what to pick for the level 7 ones. Trip attack looks decent, but our party is a full ranged one except for a Barbarian, so knocking people prone would be mostly a disadvantage for us. Rally is cool but it eats up my bonus action and I only have 12 Charisma anyway. Disarming attack sounds promising but I'm ranged and the weapon just falls at their feet where they can just pick it up again as a free action. Defensive maneuvers sound useless as my DM never even bothers to get to me in melee, mostly because of our Sentinel Barbarian locking people down.<lb><lb>What do you guys suggest? Thanks!<lb><lb>Edit: thanks to everyone for the thorough answers! It really helped me realize the potential of all the maneuvers I didn't consider to be  very powerful.

5jolef,Firefighting,Help writing story about volunteer firefighters,"So, I'm a volunteer firefighter myself, and I was very interested in the histiry of the fire service in the cities before the paid fire service was formed. I'm looking into writing a story about an alternate universe where paid firefighting never became commonplace in the US, and volunteers instead continued to provide a majority of fire services to even the largest of cities. Paid firefighters are around, but volunteers still outnumber them greatly, and practically the only department that has no volunteers is the Federal Government/Military.<lb><lb>I would assume (and to an extent, hope) the technology in use in this bizarro world fire service isn't too different than today, except maybe some older equipment that isn't commonly in use today (three-quarter boots, long coats, belt-mounted regulators on SCBA, pompier ladders) never fully died out. I would also assume most VFDs in the cities would switch to the Prince George's County model of staffing to cope with rising call volumes and obviously don't use bells or sirens and whatnot to summon firefighters.<lb><lb>Would fights at fires still be a thing? Would old habits and terminology like ""washing the tub"" (pumping so fast that you cause the next pumper in line to overflow with water and overpower the pump), ""plug uglies"" (guys who would guard hydrants and stop outside companies from hooking up to them), and ""masheen"" (old term for fire apparatus) still be in use today? Would EMS even be a thing in the fire service? How much political power would this much, much larger volunteer fire service have? Would there still be a decline in volunteer firefighters like in real life? How would most of these departments be organized? How would newer areas like South Florida and the Southwest in general develop in particular?<lb><lb>Now, as for the story, what city should I cover?

The manager got as much information out of me as he could and I left. The next day he was at school and I asked him what happened.

6ijla0,sugarlifestyleforum,my first sugar daddy dating experience thus far and a question,"Hi all! I am new to the sugar bowl, a recent transplant in a huge, expensive city. I'm 24 and a broke student. I took a dip a couple years ago but never got too far (only went on a couple of m&amp;g's that never turned into anything.) Within the first few days of using SA here, I began talking with a man whom I immediately felt really good about. Conversation flowed, he was charming. I met him a few days later. He's just as charming in person, and very handsome. I'd have sex with him without compensation kind of handsome. Of course, he is married- and looking for a mostly physical relationship with lots of discretion. I did not anticipate this, but I agreed. We talked about life, ideologies, exchanged flirting over about 30-40 minutes and then he had to go. He slipped me $300 and dipped. I. Was. Blind-sided. How could my first meet have gone so damn well, despite my research and anticipating it going in the other direction? <lb><lb>So anyway, we arrange to meet again about a week later. Meanwhile, he's texting me about all of the dirty things he wants to do to me. We have not discussed allowance or any of the hard details yet. So I go to meet up with him at a hotel, he makes me a drink and we chat a little. I see a stack of bills of the table and he says to put that in my purse when I get a second. It's $500. I'm delighted. He puts his hands on me, it felt like something out of a movie. Sex was amazing. We laughed and had a lot of fun. It felt really good. He says he wants to meet me 2-3 times/month and doesn't care what I do or whom I date outside of him and tells me that the only other person he is sleeping with is his wife.<lb><lb>My question is, why do men who are actively sleeping with their wives still seek out sugar babies? Is it because they have the money and they can? Initially, I thought that his wife wasn't providing sex for him but I can't imagine what I could for him that his wife can't. Is that something I shouldn't think about, even? Am I letting my imagination drive me crazy?",0.15420605,5.2108757e-05,0.022386061,0.00012665016,0.014079233,0.0023489292

88yc3w,malaysia,I wish we could do more for disabled people especially those with down syndrome,"Hi malaysian redditors, do u think we should do more for down syndromes or disabled people in general in malaysia?  I feel like theres a huge difference in how they are living their lives here in compared to those who live in the western countries.  I always thought about this kid back when i was in grade school, he has down syndrome and was always getting bullied by the whole class in cluding me i know i was such a jerk :( we would spit on him and made fun of him, we didnt know he was special and thought he’s just dumb and ugly.  Back then we were just kids, we didnt know anything about down syndrome and even the teacher wasnt trained in taking care of special needs children so she just ignored us or sometimes even joined us in making fun of him, his parents ended up transferring him to another school and i have never heard from him since.  I thought about it every now and then and feel awful and wished i could personally apologize to him for being such a jerk, i wish people were more informed about how down syndromes so they could educate their kids to be more respectful and understanding towards them, not saying i blamed my parents or teachers for it back then but i just wished someone would tell us off for being little brats.  Now whenever i have spare time, i would always volunteer in my local disabled homes where most of them are kids with down syndroms and i try my best to make their days a little better.  It still saddens me how theres still so many facilites with limited access for disabled people so they cant really go anywhere, i dont know about larger cities but where i am people dont realy employ down syndromes so they mostly rely on donations from the public, sorry for my long rant i just wish we could do more for them u know :( ",0.183534,6.690951e-05,0.032038838,0.00021835444,0.023352062,0.0034368674

I understand that in-school experience is imperative for School Psychologists, especially when applying to schools.<lb>I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice about City Year? I actually looked into it, but it seems like it would be difficult because it's long daily commute and (being a heavy daily commitment) it cuts into a portion of the time I plan to study for the GRE and apply to grad schools. Most importantly, however, I really need to save up for Grad School. I have applied as a substitute teacher in several districts and my back up plan is to work in a residential home. If worse comes to worse (if I can't find a job), I will work full time at Home Depot (I already have a job there) and volunteer in schools 2 days per week as a teacher's assistant.<lb>I'm wondering: is it a mistake to disregard City Year, or is my plan just as attractive? I already have a lot of direct experience with children in an educational setting (there is A LOT of info and I didn't want to make people feel over-encumbered with info. Basically, I have been seeking a lot of volunteer experiences), so I'm not exactly a ""straight out of school"" graduate.

7tcq7i,synology,DSM6 - White login page after changing home router,"Hi all,<lb><lb>I have a weird problem that is slowly getting me crazy thinking about it.  I'll explain: I have a Synology DS716+, running version 6.1.4-15217 update 5 (latest one at the moment of this writing).  I'm logging on it using the DSM Web interface, port 5001 with 2way authentication.  I'm using multiple services, all available from the internet and working fine (SSH, Plex, Download Station, Surveillance, etc).<lb><lb>Yesterday, I've upgraded my home internet connection and in the process, changed my home router.  Since I wasn't aware that I would have to change my router, I haven't noted any specific config related to my Synology connection (port forwarding mostly, changing back the Synology from having a static IP to a dynamic one attributed by the dhcp server).  I went ahead and change the router, gave the old one back to my provider and started checking if everything was working fine.  <lb><lb>Now onto the problem, I simply cannot login on my DSM anymore.  I quickly realized that I had to get my IP from DHCP now to connect to it (gateway has changed from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.2.x) and I did so, only to get a certificate error (perfect, that means that I can access my login page).  After accepting the self-signed certificate, I'm only getting... a blank page!  No DSM login or any other feedback from the page.  The thing is, all my other services (SSH, Download Station and Plex) are accessible from my mobile device.  That means that my synology does have access to the internet.  Only thing not woring is the login page... <lb><lb>I was finally able to login on my DSM using the syno's second NIC and plugging an old router I have at home.  But the problem remains, I simply cannot access DSM from my home network.  I've tried reseting the pwd and NIC using the reset button (4 seconds), restarting DSM from ssh, using wireshark to look at the web page response.. None of that works!<lb><lb>So now I'm turning back to you, the syno community, to get hints as of what went wrong in the process and to understand why I'm having this issue.  Does anybody have any clue on what went wrong and what to do?  I do not wish to reinstall DMS for something like this!  <lb><lb>Thanks!",0.0015754588,1.1069558e-06,0.00025262593,1.1346847e-06,4.926468e-05,1.3072029e-05

He's been potty trained using a bell (stationary floor bell, not hanging bell) since he was about 12 weeks old. He has been consistent with ringing it when he has to go and hasn't had an accident in our house in months (except for one time I waited far too long to take him out in the morning...oops) Anyway, he goes to other people's houses a lot and has never had an issue going to the door to let me know he has to potty but recently he has been having accidents at my boyfriends parents house. They also have a dog that is bell trained so they have a bell next to their front door as well. I was so proud of my pup for learning where the bell was there and ringing it to go potty but then suddenly it all regressed. The last 3 times he's been there he has peed in the house. He has been to other places and homes since this began and hasn't had accidents there or at my house. I'm so confused as to why he's peeing in their house and I'm so frustrated because now I can't relax when I go there with him, I constantly have to watch him like he's 8 weeks old again.

She and girl B had been planning to share one bowl, and it had to be kinda small because girl B only had a few dollars to spare.<lb><lb> I didn't think anything of spending an extra, what, fiver? on a friend, so I offered to buy hers so she'd have her own; then girl B could also have her own/not be too tight on money.

No. I had to use my debit card to pay because this girl's bowl cost 2 or 3x what mine did/what I expected to pay. And I'm not the type to skimp on myself - I love sugar and I love chocolate.

7ba4lr,TheExpanse,Does Marco Inaros' plan make sense?,"I just finished Babylon's Ashes (I'm a ""wait for paperback"" kind of budget nerd), and I can't say I'm thrilled with Marco Inaros as a villain. He's just so. . .  well, ""dumb"" isn't the right word exactly, because it's not that he's stupid, it's that he's delusional. The specific ways his plan would fail weren't just obvious to me as a reader, they were obvious to other characters in Nemesis Games (I can't remember who, but probably Avasarala at least) who recognized that it was far easier to destroy than to build, and if the system got to rock-throwing, only warships were safe in the short-term, and everybody was fucked in the long-term.<lb><lb>So my question isn't really whether Marco's plan made sense to him, I get that he's delusional. My question is how he got anybody to sign on to his vision for killing the Earth, when he so obviously didn't have a follow-up plan.<lb><lb>To start with, a passage from Babylon's Ashes indicates that ""a fifth"" of the Martian fleet defected, plus whatever Duarte sold to the Free Navy. Assuming Duarte didn't give Inaros a larger navy than he took for himself (safe assumption?) that means the remaining loyal MCRN is at least three times the size of the Free Navy. Are there countervailing facts from the text that I missed here, or does a post-rockfall Free Navy already start from a position of being totally screwed vs. the MCRN alone?<lb><lb>Then there's the UN Navy. It's smart to keep Earth just *mostly* dead in order to keep the UN Navy pinned down defending what remains, but is that a forever-plan? Is there any long-range plan for actually defeating the UN Navy, or preventing the remnants of the UN fleet from simply grief-fucking the shit out of the Belt after the Earth dies? Belters believe squats don't give a shit about Belter lives, right, so why would Belters not think that eventually Earthers would crack every major Belter station open and embrace the same kind of scorched-Earth (scorched-station?) tactics that they themselves initiated?<lb><lb>Now, I get why Inaros himself didn't think this through, he's delusional. But he didn't pull this off alone. I'd love to say Duarte is the true mastermind here, and his only goal was to sow strife in Sol to give him some breathing room to do whatever he needs to do in Laconia, but it still doesn't let all the people who enabled Inaros off the hook. What was Michio Pa thinking? She either knew about the genocide beforehand, or after it happened it wasn't a dealbreaker for her. Sanjiani, with all his economic models, apparently believed the war would end immediately upon rocks hitting the Earth, that somehow the remaining UN and MCRN fleets just wouldn't impact his economic forecasting. Are all these people just profoundly stupid? Or have I missed something as a reader that made it reasonable for competent people to endorse Inaros' genocidal and ultimately suicidal plan?",0.1934339,0.00012389105,0.23527315,0.00013420754,0.015353241,0.001645864

But another friend of mine is a staff member of another finalist corps, (Corps B) and he keeps encouraging me to march there, saying I will have a better experience and become a better player there. However, I feel that I won't be as welcomed, since Corps B is more elite and I'm a rookie, and I'm somewhat lacking in the talent that I've seen from Corps B. I have also talked to a friend who has marched at both Corps A and B and he preferred the atmosphere of Corps A. Assuming that I'm lucky enough to be offered a spot at both corps, I'm torn between the two.

8andb9,AutoModerator,"Set up AutoMod to only allow crossposts (no other links or self posts) from a whitelist of subreddits, and apply flair based on the linked subreddit?","I'd like to set up a sub that acts as an aggregator of a defined list subreddits through the crosspost functionality.

6ejhdi,Hunting,Sentimental Gander Mountain Rambling,"Today I picked up a few things at Gander Mountain, but also held off on a few things, hoping the discounts at this store (which is liquidating) will get better as the months pass. My shopping experience surfaced a lot of feelings I didn't expect. An older gentleman working in the archery section - who had fixed my compound a few times in the past - walked with me through a few aisles as we discussed whether it was worth waiting for better discounts on some non scent detergent and a few other items. We hit a bunch of subjects (ozone, 2 or 3 blade broadheads, how expensive the vaginal secretion ingredient is for the high end evercalm stick), and shared a few hunting stories. I bet that guy has enjoyed his time with a lot of the customers. Maybe the hometown bow shop isn't as common as it used to be, but every now and then you get a competent enthusiast, even at a big box store, and that's nice. I bought a pair of guide series stretch early season archery camo gloves 40% off. You know, I wore a guide series pant + jacket combo that lasted for at least ten years, warm and waterproof the entire time, and probably cost me $150 total brand new. I don't care what anybody says guide series has delivered millions of comfortable hunts to people at a great value. I'm 38 now, and I wonder how many times I popped into Gander Mountain in the past 15 or 20 years to stock up on something. I wonder how much money I've spent on gear and consumables. And yes there's a changing business model, and I'm on amazon as much as the next guy, but I'm sure a lot of hard working people dumped their lives into making Gander Mountain what it is. More and more, our purchases are not going to be made with a human interaction, other than reading some reviews or back n forth with strangers on a forum. At the same time, I've never had so much access to quality hunting information as I do now, via Reddit, Facebook, hunting beast, etc. and I've gone off the deep end with habitat management in the past few years. This hunting thing is evolving so much over time, and it's interesting to look back and think about all the slow and steady changes. AND ITS MORE A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE THAN ITS EVER BEEN. Want to close in on a buck in its bed? Somebody can tell you how. Want to grow soybeans? Somebody can help. Elk in CO? There's 100 websites on that. It is crazy, and particularly since the late 90s, technology seems to be changing the way we experience hunting  exponentially. And yet nature feels almost exactly the same. I hope a lot of younger folks on here stay with it; it will teach you patience and give you lots of opportunities - if you look for them - to interact with a lot of interesting people, some where you least expect it. I've met a few really awesome people right in this sub. Also... be ready to suck at whatever type of hunting you do, for a long time, unless your cousin has a perfect duck blind that you can sit in. But that will be, in some way, less rewarding than the skill you work to learn. It's a marathon not a sprint; but at the same time, be curious and as clever as you can, and learn as fast as you can. As you get better - which will take time - it will get more and more rewarding and you will have more friends to share it with. Particularly if you haven't started a family yet, man get after it, this is the time to pack in the memories, shared with as many people as you can include. Ultimately it's the people, whether they're sitting in an archery / bait shop in 1993 tweaking your bow string, or they're filming you in HD from a tree stand next to you in 2017, that you will remember the most.

I realize that.<lb>I've wanted a nose job since my face grew/matured around age 12.<lb><lb>I'm almost 23 now. Guys, let me tell you, I think about getting my nose done **constantly.** Always. Every single day. I look like a witch. No matter how much makeup I put on, how nice my clothes are, or how much effort I put into my hair, I feel unattractive. It's like taking the shot and missing every single time. It is so frustrating and disheartening. I honestly am ashamed and feel a little foolish when I go on little shopping sprees or buy new outfits. 1) That's money that could be going towards saving up for a nose job, and 2) You're just going to look like a well-dressed witch, you moron.

At first I would just see things, but more recently I have been hearing full fledged auditory hallucinations of whatever is happening in the ""dream."" At the time that this starts happening, I start to sense something in my head. It feels sort of like a buzzing sensation but there is no actual buzzing sound. I would say vibrating but I feel like that would get confused with the vibrational state (which I don't believe this is since it's in my head but not anywhere else). After a while the hypnagogic visions and sounds go away as does the ""vibrating."" Then for a minute or two I experience the ""swaying"" sensation as it is often called. Eventually that subsides as well, and everything returns to normal. This whole process usually lasts 15 minutes from the time I lay down to the end of the swaying, and I don't actually fall asleep during the process. Is there anyone who could help me understand what this is and help me on how to go deeper? (Also if someone who is also into the spiritual stuff behind AP wants to explain something on that side of it to me, feel free to PM me since religion/spirituality usually stays at a minimum here.)<lb><lb>Thanks a lot, and good luck to all those trying like myself!<lb><lb><lb>EDIT: If anyone plans on suggesting anything about psychedelics or DMT, save your breath (or uh fingers I guess lol).

The stickiness of it was great, but I've read some comments saying after a month Lululemon mats just fall apart. Needless to say I've done some research and need some advice whether to try out another Lululemon mat with a solid surface instead, or purchase a B Yoga mat, or a Jade mat? Open to others as well.

The CCG would be far more utilized in hunting terrorist ghouls than all ghouls. they could even segregate ghoul schools and hospitals and stores, until the larger public is ready to accept them. this would increase public order exponentially. most of our MC ghouls just want a peaceful life, no sense in slaughtering innocents for a fixable problem. the oggai and the quincky and all the other hybrids are basically human experimentation. which do you think is cheaper continuous human experimentation, or cloning flesh. they could have cloning plants that hire scientists to clone engineers to design, builders to build and factory workers to work. they could have ghoul schools that teach ghouls at a young are to control their powers rather than cannibalize. ghouls could be incorporated into the army. do you know the incredible asset that ghouls would be in combat? from a pragmatic standpoint the CCG and their operations are a complete waste of taxpayer money and an active menace to society. <lb><lb>any thoughts or arguments are welcome   ",0.0054556564,9.1696126e-07,0.0003745038,7.2707786e-07,0.00014168413,4.073593e-05

Things started going downhill when we started living together. She was always finding reasons to be angry with me, was getting mad that I wasn't apologizing for things I wasn't sorry for, and repeatedly told me she wanted to hurt me (but didn't know why). I ended up telling her straight up that I didn't think the friendship would work out and that I would prefer if from now on we only talked when we had to, about stuff like rent and electric bills. It resulted in her having a temper tantrum where she kicked my door and screamed at me for over and hour. She told me her behavior was because she ""fell in love with me,"" but I really don't buy that for a second.  <lb><lb><lb>Since then she's just left huge messes, never taken out the trash, paid rent late, and talked loudly on the phone until 2am or longer. Oh, she also took one shot of gin, and projectile vomited all over my bathroom while saying, ""thank god this isn't MY bathroom."" Her bathroom is in her room, which I don't go inside of, so I took a trip to taco bell to use their bathroom that night. Sad. The morning after that, we get a letter about a noise complaint because she had been screaming. She proudly posted it on twitter.  <lb><lb><lb>Fast forward to a Tuesday night in February, she goes out around 6pm, and I go to the grocery store around 8pm. I come back around 9, and I  lock the door behind me, put away my groceries, and go to bed early for once.  <lb><lb><lb>At around 2am I hear her shouting and kicking my door. She says, ""why'd you lock the door you piece of shit?"" I just go back to bed.  <lb><lb><lb>I've heard her mention the incident over the phone a couple of times, so I know she's mad about it, and is under the impression that I did it on purpose, while I ""knew she was outside."" I have no idea if she had her keys with her at the time, or if she had to call the apartment to unlock the door. If she knocked to be let in, I didn't hear it, because I was asleep. She did not call or text.  <lb><lb><lb>Today I was going out to get my laundry, and she was sitting at the table on her phone. I go out with my basket (I do not lock the door as I leave because I will only be out a short time) and get my laundry. When I come back, the door won't open, so I get my keys, unlock it, and go inside, no problem.  <lb><lb><lb>I didn't suspect her initially, but I was concerned so I called maintenance and they're coming to see if there's anything wrong with the lock.  <lb><lb><lb>I feel pretty dumb now though. After discussing the situation with a friend, I am almost certain she did it in an act of revenge. I think she thought I wouldn't have had my keys on me since I was just going out for laundry real quick, and I would ""know how it felt"" or something. I don't want to be like her and automatically assume this was an act of aggression, but... I am quite sure it was.  <lb><lb><lb>I am wondering if I should say anything to her. I am only stuck with her for 2 more months. I feel like I can hold out.

I know I am spineless for not doing more to get the money she owes me. But she sent that as a text so I have it in writing that she will give me the money.

From writing our experiences down to audio recordings and a few times where we actually film it with our cell phones. For me, things have apparently calmed down as I haven't had any personal experiences for a few months. However, my girlfriend feels she has been experiencing things more such as touching in the middle of the night or movement of the bed.<lb><lb>As of tonight, I finally had a new experience with my girlfriend as we're laying here on the couch watching TV. She was sitting up on the couch as I was laying across with my head resting on her lap. It's been warm lately in California so we have a fan blowing on us set to low. There is an empty water bottle sitting next to her on a side table that suddenly started rocking back and forth, to the point that she felt it was going to fall over. The fan was blowing for a good long while, not oscillating and just pointed straight at us. The bottle was still for the longest of time before that happened. It was rocking so much that she tapped me on the shoulder to point it out and, by the time I looked up, it was slowing to a stop.<lb><lb>Seeing as we were trying to experiment with SnapChat months prior, she brought out her phone and started to mess with the filters to see if anything could be caught. Nothing. Then she started to film the bottle and nothing happened. She snapped a few more pictures with her regular camera settings to see if anything showed itself and still nothing.<lb><lb>She deleted those photos and video since nothing was appearing. Then I started to get involved as you'll see in this video.<lb><lb>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0b41sv0RgM<lb><lb>It's not until the 2:30 mark of the video that you'll see what we're talking about. As I get up to leave the room, I cross in front of the fan but it's not until I'm well out of the room and standing in the bathroom when the bottle and wrapper move. I come back in to ask another question and leave again (not passing by the fan because I'm not fully in the living room at this time), and the bottle and wrapper move again. You'll hear me say it has to be because of me crossing in front of the fan, but it doesn't explain the initial moving that set this all off and the second time where I wasn't near the fan at all. After we stop recording, we tried multiple experiments to see if we can debunk the bottle moving. From me crossing the fan again to just standing in front of the fan. Nothing causes the bottle to move.<lb><lb>It was very strange.<lb>",0.0009214872,6.098554e-08,9.8732875e-05,5.3662003e-08,1.626244e-05,2.1487422e-06

66bl6j,thewalkingdead,[COMIC] Something I realized with my friends and the series...,"So, a couple of days ago, my friends and I were discussing the future of TWD. They know I'm a comic reader and I tend to stay out of things, except for playing devil's advocate, but that day they wanted to know something from the comics. They asked me if Negan died in the comics, and they were absolutely STUNNED when I said he was still alive. <lb><lb>I never really looked at it from this angle, but I think that everyone that is watching the show, especially with today's culture, is expecting Negan to die at the end of S8. He's portrayed as a guy who is cruel and all that, and my mom (who is current on the show but hasn't touched my comics) thinks he's a horrible person who she would like to see die. It never crossed my mind that people would think that Negan would die, partially because I never felt that way while reading the comics. I never really rooted for Negan's death (aside from Issue 100) and I always respected him as a leader and as saw him as someone who was smart and charismatic. <lb><lb>So now I guess I have to ask all the comic readers: Did you expect Negan to live or die? Do you think it's weird that show-watchers expect him to die? Would you rather him be dead or alive?",0.11342171,0.00032213476,0.011886011,0.009159983,0.008746331,0.0051729106

I know husbro would be accepting but he is not exactly savvy in this field.<lb><lb>For over 10 years now I have happily identified as queer, but only in my sexuality. But I have been kind of questioning what gender means to me for years. I have never felt a strong connection to female or male, though there are plenty of traditionally masculine and feminine things that I like.<lb><lb>But the thing is... I'm AFAB and present as femme. I just feel like I am not genderqueer enough. I would love to present more masc at times but my body is not suited for the androgynous look. I have always had some discomfort with my body regarding my lack of a penis (sorry TMI), but I actually am pretty okay with my ""feminine curves"" and think I look killer in a dress.<lb><lb>And I know gender presentation and gender identity are not the same thing, and if another AFAB femme-presenting GQ told me this, I would reassure them 100% that they are legitimate. But I just feel like people are going to think of me as ""queering cis-ness"" or something. Which I could hardly blame them for, especially since I am married to a cis male (though we are poly).<lb><lb>I guess up until now all of this has kind of made me push gender questioning to the back of my mind, and since I don't have a pronoun preference (I'd happily go by either she/her, they/them, or he/his) or any serious dysphoria, I just figured if I ignored it, it would go away.<lb><lb>BUT IT WON'T FUCKING GO AWAY.<lb><lb>I just today logged on to my old FetLife profile that I probably hadn't touched in years, and when I went to update my profile, I saw that it was already talking about exploring my gender identity. I have no idea why but it just made me start crying. <lb><lb>I have had this same problem with my sexuality, being functionally pansexual (though I don't like using that term for myself) and married to a man, I'm not queer enough for the LGB crowd, and now thinking I'm genderqueer but since I present femme and don't have preferred pronouns I am not queer enough for the genderqueer community.<lb><lb>I was thinking about changing up my presentation just to see how it made me feel so if anybody has any tips on how a person with boobs (and I would rather not bind) and pretty thick thighs can pull off a more masc look I would appreciate it. I'm at least thinking of getting a more ""butch"" haircut and see how I like it (only thing is my MIL does my hair but that is a whole other cup o' drama).<lb><lb>I don't know. I'm sure society has conditioned me to feel safe presenting as femme, but I also don't want to present masc just to fit in with the queer community. How do you even figure out what is really YOU? There is so much pressure from every which way it seems impossible.<lb><lb>Thanks for reading my screed.",0.17030479,5.165359e-05,0.119405404,5.161976e-05,0.011982548,0.00053717213
7aekpi,aznidentity,Getting Woke may have had more negative consequences than positive for me...,"Update: Thanks for the community support everyone. However, perhaps my initial post made it seems like I want to be blissfully ignorant like Cypher in the Matrix. But this is only 50% true...I just want be blissful again. It means that I have to re-wire my thinking pattern so that I stop seeing the negatives first and so that I stop making judgments on people whom I don't know. I believe that my negativity is severely triggered by the mostly negative posts about WMAFs in the media that are posted here. Instead I think that we should try to upload more positive news about Asians (male or female or other)--and since western media tend not to have much positive coverage of Asians, we can share our own stories (why not?). <lb><lb>Original Post:<lb><lb>I discovered hapas and aznidentity about a year ago and became woke shortly thereafter. I suppose it was like religion, where suddenly things made sense and dots connected. <lb><lb>But I am 100% sure that becoming woke has actually made my life worse than better:<lb><lb>1. Nothing has really changed aside from my formerly positive/neutral outlook on life into a negative outlook.<lb><lb>2. Those Asian girls that ignore Asian guys, continue to do so. The only difference is that I get upset over something I never had any control over to begin with.<lb><lb>3. Furthermore, I found myself viewing all Asian girls negatively if they even if they are inherently neutral with regard to their racial preferences but happen to be with a white guy. I used to get along fine with nearly all girls, Asian or not. <lb><lb>4. I never thought anything of Asian girls who dated White guys when I was younger. I grew up around both AMWF (not many of course) and WMAF, so Perhaps I was just ignorant and oblivious. But I was as far from racist as one could imagine. There were many Asian girls that I ignored even though they were for sure interested in me. They later dated White guys. Yet, it wasn't until after I became woke that I thought negatively of them, even though I had no interest in them then or now...(selfish behavior, no?)<lb><lb>5. This has progressively gotten worse and made me negative in all aspects of my life rather than just my view of white washed Asian girls. I believe it now has affected my career as well. I recently have started to interview for jobs after my startup attempt has not panned out, and thoroughly believe that this negative outlook on life was portrayed through my words and body language during interviews. <lb><lb>In conclusion there is only real one result from my wokeness:<lb><lb>I have become a negative person...Now I believe that my internal feelings of negativity scare people when I discuss Asians in general. So I need to watch myself when I discuss this topic. Also it seems that I come across as negative when discuss career topics as well, so I need to watch myself there as well...<lb><lb>Basically, I feel like I need to go back to my previous unwoke state positive frame of mind, by breaking the cycle of negativity and I need to delete reddit to do so and take time for self-reflection.<lb><lb>Acknowledge, but don't partake. Don't become that which you despise.<lb>",0.06541654,1.8818211e-05,0.0013606804,6.1663064e-05,0.004365187,0.005797077

I told you I was, remember?” <lb><lb>“Yea, but I didn't think you meant it. Come.

He gave me a big hug when he saw I was sitting at his side again.<lb><lb>“I am thankful for my family and friends and all the love at this table.” Stephen said with a wry smile. He looked at me:<lb><lb>“I regret how I treated you, how I wasn’t there for you and not being a good brother.”<lb><lb>His sincere words made me tear up. <lb><lb>“I wasn’t the good brother to you,” I responded.<lb><lb>“Because now you’re gone, and I miss you every day, we all do.” <lb><lb>“What the hell do you mean!?” I said abruptly as I looked at everyone at the table. “Can someone tell me what’s going on?!” <lb><lb>“We’re dead, Stu” my dad tugging at my arm. <lb><lb>“We are, dad?” <lb><lb>“Yea, we’re all together now and always will be.”<lb><lb>Accepting this truth, I sat quietly as everyone shared their good thanks.<lb><lb>“I’m thankful for all the wonderful hospitality you have shown me,” Joseph added.<lb><lb>He then reached underneath the table, revealing a revolver <lb><lb>“And I regret..” <lb>",0.010923435,4.0994814e-06,0.0014091609,7.66172e-06,0.00040534037,0.00014650237

We've never been particularly close, but our group of friends used to go on nights out together a bit and I'd probably see her every 2-3 weeks or so, and since we've known each other for a while now and been drunk in clubs together a fair bit, it feels like we know each other pretty well even though we don't really talk outside of that.<lb><lb>Went on a big/druggie night out just under a month ago and I saw her for the first time since July, and we were both pinging hard, and we hugged and talked for ages, and I told her how beautiful she was and she seemed pretty emotional.

I don't get bad comedowns at all, but after seeing her at this event I felt horrendous and was bed-ridden for days and I haven't been able to get her out of my head. I came close to blocking her on facebook because just seeing her pop-up on my news feed from time to time is enough to make me feel sick or tearful and occasionally take valium.<lb><lb>I went to an all guys school, and am on a pretty male-dominated degree course, but I'm friends with a fair few girls and have no issues being around them or talking to them, but when I start to like someone it really screws me up, like it's either all or nothing, I can never just have a 'minor crush'. But this is 10x worse than it's ever been before and isn't getting any better, and I think that feeling so intimate with her while rolling, then not seeing her for the best part of a year isn't helping :(<lb><lb>I've tried speaking to a few friends from my school about it, and while they said liking girls can be hard sometimes, I get the impression none of them have it nearly as bad as it hits me. My mental health isn't the best, but this is significantly worse than usual and it's stopped me caring about anything else - deadlines/assignments/etc all seem irrelevant when I think about her. The weird thing is it's not that I want to be with her, well I mean I do, obviously, but it doesn't feel like some desire or craving, it's more like the fact she's so perfect in my eyes is what makes me feel sick.<lb><lb>Not really sure what any advice anyone can give, but if anyone's felt anything similar please share because this is kinda screwing me up and I'm feeling pretty lost :( Thanks x",0.008831275,3.8719034e-07,0.0006630765,4.6637706e-07,0.00017295439,2.777471e-05

I also regularly see comments about things Linus from LinusTechTips has said or done with his builds.<lb><lb>Jay and Linus are youtube personalities. Posting videos comes first with them because that's how they make money. They need to post lots of videos to keep their audience engaged and keep revenue coming in. They can't put in the time to fact check everything extensively, do exhaustive testing, or do exhaustive analysis. And sometimes they just make mistakes.<lb><lb>Furthermore, they typically receive engineering samples for their reviews. Those samples are hand-picked by the manufacturer because they're the best example they have to send out for review. In the case of CPU's and GPU's that means they'll overclock better than other production examples. In the case of VUE that may very well mean that what Jay was given to review is chemically different than what you have been sold. It's not unreasonable to imagine that Primochill sent Jay some pre-production fluid and then made changes to the formula for production. Even if the youtube personality you're watching is trying to be honest, factual, and unbiased, manufacturers are not always working with them towards those goals.<lb><lb>You should treat everything on these youtube channels with a fair amount of skepticism. Do not treat their word as gospel. Do not make a buying decision based only on something you've seen on youtube.

79met7,HollowKnight,Tips and strategies for the Grimme Troupe's final boss!,"We're all probably getting our asses kicked by this guy, but after loooots of experimenting and sudden realizations, I thought I'd share my strategies so that you won't have to go through as much pain as I did! Read the bold sentences if you want the TL;DR.<lb><lb>#Preperation<lb><lb>* Straight off the bat, you should **equip Joni's Blessing.** There is little to no room for healing at all during this entire fight, so doubling your health will greatly increase your chances of survival.<lb><lb>* You should **equip Fragile Heart** to further increase HP. Most people didn't turn this into an unbreakable charm yet, so you might be thinking, wouldn't I have to repair it every single fight? The answer is nope! Fragile charms don't break during dream fights!<lb><lb>* Definitely **equip Flukenest.** Most people don't know the value of this charm, it's actually a godsend for most boss fights. If you use your magic attack in point blank range (which you will usually be in because he's always next to you), it will deal an INSANE amount of damage.<lb><lb>* You should probably have a few more free charm notches. You can equip whatever you want in them. My personal recommendation is longnail or stalwart shell, but it really doesn't make that huge of a difference.<lb><lb>* It should go without saying, but **you shouldn't even attempt this boss without all of the upgrades you can find throughout the game, especially shade cloak.** I'm pretty sure the boss is actually impossible without that upgrade.<lb><lb>#The actual fight<lb><lb>Now that you're prepared for the fight, lets talk about what the hell you should even be doing rather than dying and ranting on Discord.<lb><lb>* First thing's first, know when to and when not to attack. You should stay defensive throughout this entire fight because this boss has TONS of HP. **He only has two attacks that actually have a good opening**: The attack where he summons pillars of fire, and the attack that spawns 4 hell bats. If he's doing an attack that's not any of these two, you should primarily focus on dodging and running away.<lb><lb>* Know that you know when to attack, how should you attack? First, **unless you're going to use your magic attack, always keep your nail charged.** When there's an opening, unleash your attack! Keep in mind that using your charged attack will keep you in place for like a quarter of a second, so you might get hit if you use it at a bad time.<lb><lb>* When exactly is a good time to attack? It's a lot simpler than you think. **When he uses the bats attack, jump over the first bat and then dash towards him while he finishes attacking.** If you time it right, you'll be standing right in front of him and you can get a good 1-2 hits in, including your charged attack. This is also the perfect time to use your magic attack, since you're in point blank range. As for his pillars of flame attack, the openings for that are pretty obvious; just make sure you don't get too greedy.<lb><lb>* The most difficult attack is definitely the one where he charges forwards, uppercuts, and then explodes into a rain of fire. The fire is super unpredictable and has a huge hitbox, how the hell do I dodge that? Simple: **Don't waste your shadow dash on his first attack.** By simply walking the opposite direction to his charging attack, you can easily stay out of range. **As soon as the fire starts to rain on you, that's when you use your shadow dash. That, or just stay under him and you'll easily see them coming.** If you're cornered and you're forced to shadow dash through him, run like hell to the other end of the arena, as the fires should be out of range. <lb><lb>* **The attack where he stays in the center and spawns hundreds of flaming balls isn't triggered randomly!** This attack is actually triggered every time you deplete 25% of his HP, and is a great way to tell how close you are to killing him. He does this attack exactly 3 times before dying. Also, never use your double jump while dodging these flames. It'll only throw you off balance and make you hit the flames above you.<lb><lb>And that's it! The rest of the fight is fairly straightforward. Good luck!",0.079969,4.373291e-05,0.0077706105,0.00040507884,0.0063120853,0.0014243216
6fb769,migraine,Increase in migraine frequency with Topamax,"Hi everyone,<lb><lb>I have a question about Topamax use.  My story is kind of a drawn out one...  I was diagnosed with migraines at 12 (I'm now 29) and had them under control with an episode about bi-weekly.  However, back in March I had one that persisted for 18 days and I missed almost a full week of work because of it, I ended up in the ER, which I have never done before.  While there they administered a lumbar puncture and CT Scan and after still not finding relief my PCM put me on Topamax 50mg and finally gave me a referral to see a Neurologist.  I've never taken daily meds and have only ever taken abortives so I was hesitant to start taking Topamax.  <lb><lb>After my first visit with my Neurologist at the start of May he increased my dosage of Topamax to 100mg and prescribed me a new abortive of Relpax 40mg (before I was taking Maxalt dissolvable, which now I find to have been more effective for me).  <lb><lb>My issue with Topamax though is that it doesn't help me and I feel as though it is actually causing headaches/migraines because I have had what feels like no relief when before I started daily maintenance in March my episodes were (as I mentioned) bi-weekly at most.  Now I have at least a dull headache every day and a full blown migraine every other day.  I don't like to use my abortives a lot because I know they can cause rebounds so I try to use them sparingly so I resort to Tylenol 325mg or 500mg.

4vt1o4,sales,Selling educational package tips - Help needed!,"Hey everyone,<lb><lb>So I work for the Executive Education department of a large university in a fairly isolated part of North America (I want to avoid specifics). We have two types of programs: Open Enrollment and Custom programs. Custom programs are created for specific businesses to cater to their staff learning needs and the open enrollment is for the general public to pay and attend. Open enrollment programs are usually priced around $6000 per attendee and custom can be $100,000+ per year for ~10 attendees.<lb><lb>I have been tasked with getting appointments with businesses who are potentially interested in custom programs as well as going door to door to businesses generating interest for the open enrollment programs. There are around 40 businesses in my market who have the annual revenue and employee amount to consider a custom program and around 800 that might consider sending staff to open enrollment programs.<lb><lb>The department is fairly new - it's only been around for a couple of years - so a lot of people still don't know we exist. The custom programs have been around from the start and the open enrollment programs are running for the first time this Fall. We have around 4 current clients utilizing our custom programs and the feedback we get from their attendees is generally very good. For our open enrollment programs, we are on average receiving 2 inquiries a week in total over the 4 programs we're marketing for (which is awful). This is from marketing in magazines, all relevant social media platforms, adwords and from networking events, etc. We need around 10 attendees per program to break even on costs. FYI I was employed in Mid May 2016 and the open enrollment programs take place mid September 2016.<lb><lb>To cut a long story short - what can I do to increase results with the open enrollment programs? It's been suggested before that I create seminars and invite c-suite employees and pitch the open enrollment programs during them, but I don't have the authority or resources to just be creating those all the time. The market that I work in likely wouldn't allow for that anyway due to a lower population - I might be lucky to get 2 or 3 people turn up. Going door to door to businesses generally isn't effective because people aren't likely to make a knee jerk decision to sign up for a $6000+ program on the spot. They'll take it away and mull over it with their HR team and maybe decide on something 6 months down the line (which by that point, it'll be too late). Even phoning these businesses isn't generating a great response and getting past the gatekeeper to speak to a decision maker is a challenge. <lb><lb>I guess what I'm trying asking everyone is: Is what i'm doing currently to generate interest pointless (when there clearly isn't a large demand for these open enrollment programs) and is there more effective ways to fill these seats? Should I just suggest to the Director of the dept that these open enrollment programs aren't generating enough interest and we should put them off for a year to develop them and really find out what the market is looking for/needs?<lb><lb>This is a very garbled post and more of a rant so I apologize - I'm just getting to the end of my tether :(<lb><lb>Thank you to everyone in advance for any advice.",0.001442857,6.1082865e-08,0.000105946376,6.103768e-08,2.454952e-05,5.7536354e-06

6gq7r2,residentevil,"Resident Evil 4 was the last ""true"" game in the series.","It's been a subject of debate on GameFAQs and Facebook comments forever. The difference between RE4 and RE5 was Mikami's involvement. RE4 was an opportunity to evolve RE's mechanics. In place of typical survival horror, much of its element came in the form of pressure. You were being cornered by smarter enemies, giving you no place to escape. The game also took an action base. But it retained the storyline elements leading up to it from the first few games in the series.<lb><lb>RE5 felt like a radical change. In place of any kind of horror, it took place in broad daylight and there was no trace of horror. It felt like Gears of War for gameplay, with monsters there just to kill. Items were abundant, and your partner had your back. <lb><lb>RE6 was said to be a bad game. Moving on.<lb><lb>RE7 supposedly brings back true survival horror. It doesn't make direct references to past games and feels like a reboot of the series in its entirety. It's scary again, bringing much of the element missing from the series from RE4 onward.<lb><lb>But my point is, I don't like when RE4 is treated like a bastard child among dedicated members of the fanbase. It's one of the greatest games of all time and has some of the most impressive gameplay mechanics and visuals ever seen. Plus it has a ton of extras and gives you plenty of weapon variety as well. The mainstream fanbase loves the game for what it is, while denizens who played the PS1 titles felt it would never be a true game, even despite the series' creator directing the game himself.

I love cricket and I love my country. When I heard that Australia was touring South Africa for Test cricket I was excited, so excited that I tried to convince my wife that we should buy tickets for our whole family - 4 boys - to go for a day of the Newlands Test. She said we couldn’t afford it - she was right. So we settled on just a ticket for me and the one son who enjoys cricket the most. We saved up and at the end of last year we bought the tickets and gave them to him and me as our Christmas present - 3rd Test, Newlands, Day 3, Saturday, March 24.<lb><lb>It turns out we gave him the best present, a present money can’t buy - anticipation! As his brothers busily played with their latest toys on Christmas day and experienced the joy of instant gratification, he just sat there with a piece of paper and at the dreams it represented. 3 months is a long time for an 8-year-old to wait, but wait he did. And with every month, every week, every day that passed by the anticipation and the excitement grew. A day of Test cricket with his dad, at Newlands, watching the Aussies! For days leading up to it he couldn’t sleep.<lb><lb>When I woke up on Saturday morning, I looked to the skies and feared the weather would steal his joy. Four years of drought for Cape Town and the one day we’re planning on going out to the cricket it looked like it was going to rain. Little did I know at that stage that the storm that would steal our joy had nothing to do with the clouds hanging over Table Mountain.<lb><lb>I wish you could see my son!<lb>I wish you could have seen him yesterday. Perhaps you did - we were on the boundary, front row, around third-man at the Presidents Stand, decked out in all our Aussie gear, proudly supporting our team. Did you see us? Probably not! I wish you could have seen his face - filled with awe and excitement. Giddy with joy, amazed as his favourite players performed with all their effort and skill right in front of him. He kept leaning over to me throughout the day and saying, “Hey dad ... Merry Christmas”! We had an awesome day.<lb>But I wish you could see my son today!<lb><lb>You aren’t his role model. I’ve never understood why people think sports stars are role models. I make sure my 4 boys have great male role models in their lives - they’ve never idolised sports stars.

What you did hurt us all badly. I wish you could see my son today. He’s broken, shattered!

68mrg2,3d6,Help me optimise and fluff a Moonbow Warlock 5/ Mystic 15,"I've seen this build mentioned on Giant in the Playground, but I can't actually find the original build mentioned. I sketched it out and it seems like a pretty strong build.<lb><lb>In terms of build - I think High Elf is a good choice for the character. I get good Dex &amp; Int. I'm unsure as to what I should take for the cantrip, this build really doesn't need them, but I'm thinking Gust to match with some of the flavor added later w/ mystic.<lb><lb>Obviously, Warlock 5 is for the invocations. Thirsting Blade &amp; Moon Bow are absolutely required. Then some random invocation and swap it out for Improved Pact Weapon. This gives me 2 attacks, with a +1 Moon Bow (ranged Smites!). <lb><lb>In terms of spell choice, the cantrips really aren't needed but Mage Hand, Minor Illusion and Friends kind of match the flavor, and are definitely useful. I know six Warlock spells, and I'd say that Hex, Faerie Fire, Mirror Image, Misty Step, Fly and Blink are probably excellent choices here. I'll mostly be attacking with the bow, and anything that keeps me out of trouble is perfect.<lb><lb>Then, Mystic 15. Order of the Wu Jen is by far the best choice here. I get spell slots which feed into Moon Bow Smite, and I get some more Wizard spells. Counterspell, Dispel Magic and Find Familiar seem like pretty good choices here.<lb><lb>For disciplines, I get two Wu Jen disciplines, and seven of my choice. At level 1 mystic, I think that I go for Nomadic Arrow<lb>for obvious reasons, Mastery of Air for flying and maybe Mastery of Weather for the AoE. This also gives me that kind of ""Airbender"" feel that combos so nicely with the Gust cantrip.<lb><lb>For my other 6 Disciplines - Celerity seems great for mobility and the bonus action extra attack. Nomadic Step seems great for mobility and getting the hell out of dodge. Psionic Weapon helps vs stuff with a lot of armor. I get 3 more talents. Nomadic Mind seems like it would help the exploration and social bit of the game. Mantle of Joy seems pretty decent, as does Intellect fortress - in combination you can buff your allies' saves and then get them to immediately make those saves.<lb><lb>Edit: I get 3 talents, probably Mind Meld, Blind Spot &amp; Delusion. I don't need any combat ones.<lb><lb>For stats, I think an ~~8/16/14/16/10/10~~ 8/16/12/16/10/13 spread is pretty solid. I get 4 ASIs, and I think they go to Sharpshooter, Dex x2 and Int x1.<lb><lb>For flavour, I like the idea of a blind elf who made a pact with a Fey being to get his sight back, but after getting his sight back and realising how easy it is to manipulate people's perception of reality, he chose to focus on seeing things how they truly are.<lb><lb>Any tips/comments/suggestions?

56st0i,Swimming,Sensitivity to Cooler Temperatures Out of the Pool,"I've been searching around, and didn't find much that's very obvious.  I thought I'd toss this out there just to see if I'm weird, and/or I should just stop thinking about it so much and keep swimming :)<lb><lb>I've been a very consistent swimmer for nearly four years now.  I'm not competitive, except with myself.  I do it mostly to _comfortably_ finish the swimming leg of triathlons as well as for general fitness.<lb><lb>I'm finishing up one of my longest breaks from swimming in those four years (a week) due to an accidental injury.  Because of my break from the pool, I realized something: I feel exceptionally cold all the time.  Right now, I feel fine in the same places/temperatures that would normally make me intermittently shiver or have gooseflesh.  I'll probably hop back in the pool this week, and everything will go back to feeling cold again.<lb><lb>Over the last year-or-so, I noticed that I was less sensitive to higher temperatures than people around me.  For example, I can run fast and long in high heat/humidity when my peers are staying indoors to run on treadmills.  I also tend to wear a sweatshirt in my air-conditioned office when my office mates are comfortable in T-shirts.<lb><lb>Of course, there are too many variables in anyone's everyday routine for me to pin this on swimming, but I thought I'd see if this is something others have experienced.  And, if I'm not alone, has anyone had any loose theories on the physiological reasons and/or some ideas about how to mitigate this?<lb><lb>My first thought is that I'm not starting my morning by burning off my glycogen.  I can accept that, but I've also tempered my carbohydrate intake while I'm recovering.  Yeah, I don't really know if I've accounted for every calorie I would have burned, but I definitely feel like I'm eating and burning less food.  It also takes me more than a week to gain a noticeable amount of weight, so I don't think it would be something like a sudden growth of my subcutaneous fat layers.  I also run in the mornings (during this break), and I didn't notice the same sensitivity when I've burned off my glycogen on those mornings.<lb><lb>Finally, if nobody else seems to experience this, that's okay.  I'm happy that my sensitivity isn't reversed (I can always put on more clothing).  I just don't want to find out I'm doing something horribly wrong and/or this would be a legitimate reason to see a doctor.

Alphabay announced early last month that they would be implementing Zcash on July 1st. It would not make sense that they only started to write the code and implement it days after the day it was supposed to become a public feature.<lb><lb>I've been watching events unfold from the sidelines and *I believe* that the RCMP/FBI raid in Trois-Rivières was indeed Alphabay. I believe that LE may be holding an admin captive.<lb><lb>What we know:<lb><lb>Shortly after Alphabay went down, [an article from tvanouvelles.ca](http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2017/07/05/la-grc-procede-a-deux-perquisitions-a-trois-rivieres) came out saying the following:<lb><lb>* There was a raid conducted in Canada by the **RCMP integrated technology crime group** and the FBI related to an international network of narcotics **and arms** sales.<lb><lb>* The raid was carried out in a private residence and ""mini warehouse"" looking for **computer equipment** (it says nothing about drugs)<lb><lb>* The people involved operated operated from in several places around the world with one man in Thailand leading a lavish lifestyle owning several cars.<lb><lb>* The most important bit: The RCMP did not comment on it, **merely stating that it was a search ""at the center of an investigation"". ""There will be others later,""** said Capt. Camille Habel. <lb><lb>It's strange to me that the paid spokespeople for Alphabay didn't get word from the admins until 28 hours after it went down. I believe that LE may have convinced the admin to give them his hard drive encryption password. **Even though the news said that there were no arrests, this is not necessarily true**. Police are allowed to misdirect and lie to the media, they do this all the time.<lb><lb>I'd like to point out the following two items from the news article:<lb><lb>It seems that **the people involved operated in several places around the world**. (They know who was involved and that there was more than one person)<lb><lb>""The police *also* arrested a man in Thailand."" (So this news article states that there *were* multiple arrests)<lb><lb>Now, on to the **why you should be concerned** bit...<lb><lb>Bitcoin blockchain analysis companies have been building unmasking technologies for the blockchain for years now, and they are quite elaborate and good at their job.

I would like to have the batteries and equipment in the house because it would then stay warm and be more secure from theft. We are located in Northern Wisconsin. I have the equipment to bury the wire no issue. Would it be better to have the solar panels, charge controller and batteries together and bring the 110v the 230ft, or would it be better to have the panels out and then bring the DC voltage the 230ft. I am guessing i could configure the panels to a higher voltage to handle any possible line loss over the distance. Any opinions on how to configure the system.

6w9gij,Charity,Help my little easy to survive,"My beloved and adorable Isaline, the sweetest cat received devastating news on Tuesday. She has Lymphoma - stage IV. Most of you reading this already know and love Isaline, but for those of you who don't let me tell you a little bit about her. She first invaded the hearts of my family with her first appearance in front of our apartment 2 years ago, this little cat was lost so I decided to take her home and adopted her. She was only one year old when I found her and she is now 3. Since the minutes I got her she being the best family pet and companion that anyone could imagine. She truly is a unique cat that is loved by us and by many around the neighborhood. Her dilemma started just three weeks ago when I noticed Isaline panting a lot and being a little clingy. My partner took her to the vet where she received a complete blood panel. Everything looked fine and was in normal range. But last Saturday night I felt a swollen lymph node in her rear leg, and then the next day under her chin. By Monday morning the lymph nodes had tripled in size. She was taken to Alison Animal Hospital in Brooklyn where samples from the lymph nodes were taken and sent out priority mail to the lab. It was an agonizing wait for my family to find out the diagnosis, but unfortunately, the next day their worst fears were confirmed -CANCER- Lymphoma. If left untreated most cats only live 2-8 weeks. It moves that fast!!! The most common treatment is Chemo and Prednisone. If lucky, a cat will go into remission for a while after the Chemo; however, it is common to have a relapse and then have to do another round of chemo. With only chemo the life expectancy is 6 months or with some luck a max of 24 months. Isaline is only 3 years old. The life expectancy of her breed is 15-17 years, with some living even 19 years. Isaline has so many more years of joy to give. This cat loves life and lives to make others happy. It is hard to imagine not doing everything humanly possible to save her life. And so, Me and my partner has spoken with the experts and they have given her hope. The option with the best possible outcome is to get her into remission with Chemo, and then perform a Bone Marrow Transplant. There are only 3 locations that do this procedure in the US. Isaline is lucky that NCSU is one of those facilities and is only 8 hours away from her home. The good news for my family is that there is a protocol that can be life saving for Isaline, but the bad news is that this protocol is estimated to cost $15,000-$25,000. This is a burden that no one family can bear, but with many much can be accomplished, and so we sincerely ask that you would consider donating to Isaline's treatment. If we can get this message out to 5,000 people that donate just $5 then we will be able to help Isaline get the life saving treatments that she needs and give back to this amazing cat that has put smiles on literally lots of faces. Isaline we love you and know you can beat this!Thank you in advance for your donations, your thoughts and your prayers!<lb>",0.006148305,1.1076241e-06,0.00044791083,2.515036e-06,0.00017742832,6.662243e-05

7wuvul,DeadBedrooms,MHL married FLL. I just need to talk.,"I need a place to talk and vent. I am so full of emotion I cannot function properly.  <lb><lb>I am a MHL 33 and my wife is FLL 29. We have one child who is 4 years old. Our sex life has been in decline for a few years now. When we first met sex was good. It was often, with intimacy, and participation from both sides equally.   <lb><lb>Our bedroom has gotten to a point were we have sex once every few months at best. When it does happen I am expected to go down on her in order to ""get things started"". Then once things are started I am expected to be on top for 99.9% of the time. There is zero foreplay, zero reciprocation of oral, and zero initiation from her. It feels very much like duty sex.  <lb><lb>Intimacy is dead as well. no kisses, hugs, cuddles, love yous, nothing. <lb><lb>I am starting to feel like I do not need these things from my wife, even though I do still need them. <lb><lb>This is destroying me right now. I have no self confidence and I feel terribly lonely and depressed. After 33 years half of those in an emotionally abusive family you would think I would have felt it all. I cannot begin to describe how horrible it feels to be so lonely while you try to sleep in the same bed as your SO.  <lb><lb>It is so hurtful because we get along fairly well as people and we are raising our child very well in my opinion. You look at our social media and it is nothing but smiles and happiness. Its all fake. The pictures on my Facebook are of what I want, not what I have.  <lb><lb>When I was younger my parents went through a divorce and it was incredibly hard for me. It took me years to get over it. Funny part is that my mom and dad are practically best friends now. I can not do that to my little one. Some days its all I can think about though.  <lb><lb>What makes things more confusing for me is I do not know if all this emotion is stemming from our dead bedroom or if its just the final piece of the fuse before the dynamite. I have 2 immediate family members that passed away recently. One was a suicide (sibling) and one was dementia (grandparent). These have been weighing incredibly heavy on me. The pain and sadness comes to me in waves without anything in sight to try and grab onto and stay afloat.  <lb><lb>I think this may have triggered some sort of mid-life crisis. It feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders. It feels like all the choices up to this point are all wrong. I have been doing a lot of viewing myself from a 3rd person perspective and I keep asking myself if this is how I want to spend the rest of my life. I keep answering no, but if I look at myself from the 3rd person as a stranger it looks like my life is perfect. <lb><lb>I cope with my dead bedroom with MB.  <lb><lb>I cope with my emotional issues with listening to music.  <lb><lb>The frequency I have to use these coping mechanisms is increasing. I am scared these will not be enough soon.  <lb><lb>I loved to go out for drives or bike rides and getting lost in the beauty of the world around me.

4ornm9,uberdrivers,LYFT Suspended me (a grandmother) after I was hassled by 20 something in Hollywood,"I'm a disabled grandmother in my mid 50s. I was driving for lyft. Around 2am this morning I picked up a couple and dropped the girl off on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood. The guy,  a hollywood hipster, wanted to hang out with her, she said no but said he could take her lyft (me) where he wanted to go. He wanted me to park so he could stalk her. I said I can't sit more than 2 minutes so be had me circle where she was. Again he made me sit at a stop sign until a car came behind me and I just started driving he started yelling at me. He finally gave me the address where he wanted to go I took him there. When we got there he said no let's go to a different place. I drove and needed to take a right on Sunset but there was a huge backup so I went down to go around the back up by taking a right on the next street. He started yelling at me again and calling me a dick (among other things) he said he could be a dick too and started telling me to take quick rights and lefts. I took it for a minute but then stopped the car and told him to get out. He refused. I took my phone, keys and pepper spray (which I didn't use and he didn't even see) I hit my panic alarm and called 911. He got out of my car and mocked me as to how long it would take for the cops to come. As he walked away I said ""no wonder she didn't want to hang out with you."" I got in my car and he started running toward me, charging at my car. I then swerved around him to get away while I was still on the phone with 911. After letting Lyft know about the situation and my concern for the girl (since he was trying to stalk her) I was informed that Lyft was a ""no weapons platform and pepper spray is a weapon"" because I told them I grabbed it in case I needed it (which I didn't).<lb><lb>This is the response I got because I keep pepper spray in my car:<lb><lb>Cody (Lyft) Jun 18, 3:17 PM PDT<lb><lb>Lyft Account Status<lb><lb>Hi Angie,<lb><lb>Lyft is investigating a potential violation of our community guidelines and Terms of Service.<lb><lb>The safety of our community is our highest priority.

88nrdc,Nest,Nest Hello and Google WiFi Issues,"I have several Nest products. Two thermostats, two cameras, two protects, and a hello that I preordered. Everything worked fine for the first week that I had the hello. Then last weekend, my old AirPort Extreme died on me. I replaced it with a Google WiFi 3 puck setup. I then was able to add everything back to my network except for the protects. After talking with nest support, the agent advised that I remove the hello (it was trying to assist with setting up the protects), add the protects, and then add the hello back to my account. This was successful in getting the protects connected, but the hello will now not connect. Nest support sent me a replacement hello.<lb><lb>After receiving the new hello, I have still been unsuccessful in setting it up. I get to the same point in the setup where it asks for network information, tries to connect for several minutes, and then spits out an error code. Typically the error code is NC006(3.3) but I have also seen NC005(4072), NC006(4003), and P014(0.80). I can assure you that my router is connected to the internet, that I entered my password correctly, and that there is sufficient WiFi signal to the hello. I can tell in the Google WiFi app that when I try to setup my hello, it is using some limited bandwidth (total of 0.4MB download and 0.3MB upload through several attempts to setup today).<lb><lb>Including time on hold, I have spent more than 6 hours with nest support. Nest support senior agent eventually told me to contact my ISP to check modem compatibility with IPv6 (check) and to see if the firewall settings on the modem were too high. My modem does not have configurable settings as far as ISP and I could find (check?). Modem is branded as a Technicolor DPC3216.<lb><lb>Any ideas Reddit?<lb><lb>Edit: thanks for the ideas everyone. I ended up resetting to factory my Google WiFi router and then setting it up with a new SSID and password. That seems to have fixed whatever was going on because all of my products seem to be working properly now. The first time I set up Google WiFi I did try using the same SSID and password as my old router. Not sure if that’s what did it but that is the only thing that I did different this time around. 🤷🏼‍♂️",0.00400664,7.5792764e-07,0.00024232385,1.5433294e-06,0.00010434568,3.9001417e-05

It's easy to forget all the hard times caused by my drinking. All the moments of shame, and moments feeling so much pain caused by my own actions. <lb><lb>That feeling of having to drive home from a friends house after passing out and feeling so disgusted by what I had said and done the night before. I remember wishing that I got in an accident rather than face the truth.<lb><lb>That feeling of waking up after a blackout not remembering but short flashes and glimpses of me cheating, being inappropriate or reckless. I had so many of these nights and caused irrevocable damage to friends and spouses. <lb><lb>I put myself in disastrous and intensely dangerous situations. The amount of effort I had to put towards denial, and repressing memories was ridiculous. <lb><lb>I am still shocked by what had to transpire before I admitted to myself that it could not go on, and I was not able to think my way out of it. What self deprecating acts and lowest lows I would have to encounter before I could finally say I have had enough. <lb><lb>The sheer amount of embarrassment I endured in front of my closest family and friends, I surely was utterly insane.<lb><lb>It's amazing how quickly all those painful memories of drinking and using fade away as you go through your journey of sobriety and ultimately self discovery. <lb><lb>I am so proud today to say I don't drink. Today it seems like such a small facet of my life, like it was always like that, like it's always been an obvious choice. But it wasn't. I was once out of control and extremely destructive.<lb><lb>For people just getting sober, all of that shit that you had to go through to get here, that pain and guilt that weighs on your shoulders like impending doom, it lifts.

I am now working with my doctor on it, but it sounds like he's going to try EVERY possible conservative approach, which is indeed the best path as we would be working on a root cause rather than simply hiding a symptom.

5e195j,projectmanagement,Need Insights. I'm a PM and I feel like I'm an overpaid glorified secretary.,"**I feel like I’m an overpaid glorified secretary as a PM.**<lb><lb><lb>**Background:**<lb><lb>I graduated this year with a Statistics degree and a CS minor. I also have a PMI-CAPM certification and I've been working as a Junior “Program” Manager at a mid-sized tech company (around 2,000 employees) that is very well known in its niche market. I’ve been there for about four months now. The company broke off from a mega tech company not too long ago. We run agile with a sprinkle of waterfall.<lb><lb>How things are set up is that all the company projects is basically run by a team of 12 program managers and the projects are mostly interconnected with dependencies. We have maybe 3-4 project managers but they are for IT and networking purposes. Some of these projects are internal and others are customer facing/product related.  Despite being in this team that basically glues everything together, I still feel like I’m not doing much. <lb><lb>**This is what I do:**<lb><lb>- Conduct 2-4 scrum meetings per day for different projects. Some don’t require daily standups as they are smaller projects. Basically I just call out names, take some notes, jot down the blocks and redirect them if they need additional help. It’s around 10 minutes per scrum. <lb>- Click around on Jira, update some stories, tracking down if any issues require urgent attention and redirecting those issues to people who can solve them. This takes maybe 30 mins to 1 hour. <lb>- Once a week I’d be in a program meeting with Directors or VPs and report project updates. Takes about 30 minutes. <lb>- Quick chat with the product team about new product requirements and requests. If the new product requirements look weird I’ll sit down and discuss them. Usually this only requires a sentence rephrase. 30 minutes tops. <lb>- Since we run the DEV – TEST – STAGE – PROD deployment environment, I have to sit through STAGE mock deployments, call out names and making sure the people who should be present are present, and take notes. After that I brush up the results on OneNote and send it out the VPs and Directors who make the final decision if we will release it or not. Takes about 2 – 3 hours but only happens like once a week. <lb><lb>**I feel like I sit around and don't do much:**<lb><lb><lb>The work above really doesn’t require much brain work. It’s just sending emails, updates, taking notes and making them look nice, update documents, calling out names in meetings and make sure who should be there is there, redirect people if they have questions and lots of chatting with people from different departments. It’s almost like a data entry job but I get to act a little more important because I have meetings and interact with directors and VPs on a semi-regular basis. <lb><lb>I also get plenty of free time in between so I spend my time reading e-books or work on my personal web-app projects instead of doing actual work. <lb><lb>**My question to experienced PMs:**<lb><lb>To the experienced PMs on this Subreddit: Is this what PMing is like?

6gkdc0,Rabbits,My bun is having trouble eating after getting spayed,"She was spayed on Friday morning and I took her home later that afternoon. She seemed to be in an okay mood but she wasn't too interested in food. I offered her a variety of foods to choose from overnight but by the morning she was still mainly disinterested except for a few nibbles of hay. I called the vet and they said to come back to get some more meds and critical care.<lb><lb>So I administered the two additional meds via syringe which she was not pleased with. But I could not get her to take the critical care. I tried so many positions, mixing with other food and treats, and I even tried putting it on her paws to see if she'd try to clean it off. Nothing worked.<lb><lb>It is now 4am on Sunday and she has since started eating just a little. She has not had any critical care, but she has eaten one mint leaf, a small lettuce leaf, a bite of a treat, a couple pellets, and a small handful of hay. She will sometimes nibble on something for a second and then she's had enough.<lb><lb>Does it seem like I should still be concerned? She's definitely trying to start eating more but she is clearly not eating the amount of food she needs to. Could I maybe just give it until the morning and see if she starts eating more or is it imperative she's force fed immediately? Will she be okay if she doesn't eat the critical care? Unfortunately the vets office is closed now that it's Sunday and the emergency clinic is quite far. An emergency visit would also cost much more than I can really afford after her surgery. I know GI stasis is something to be concerned about but I'm hopeful that if she's eating little bits at a time she won't reach that point.<lb><lb>Advice please?<lb><lb>",0.005743157,8.7003133e-07,0.0003702708,1.919261e-06,0.00016240033,2.7875969e-05

Essentially, it is a rifle whereas the Death Star was a cannon - it's not as powerful, but it's for much more precision targets. Like taking out large capital ships or a city (in our campaign, it leveled a city the PCs had just been in as retaliation for their actions). Think the level of destruction on display in Rogue One.<lb><lb>Anyway. One of my PCs is a really talented artist, and he threw together these schematics for the group to pour over and find a weakness (in my campaign, they're doing their ""trench run"" through the main cannon barrel while it charges up a shot).

The only reason that I doubt it's parroting is because I don't feel myself actively creating those words in my head; furthermore, it feels like these words and her response overlap the question or whatever I'm asking her.

7qunee,bartenders,New bar. Being treated like an amateur.,"I'm having a tricky time with my new craft cocktail joint. The other bartenders are overall nice people but are treating me like Im new to the game. Worst of all they keep telling me not to double strain cocktails served straight up because ""There's nothing in their that needs to be strained out"" (Ice shards and citrus pulp make for a shitty looking drink imo). They also keep getting on my case for using a fresh glass with fresh ice for stirred cocktails (which imo building stirred cocktails in glass using the same ice looks amateurish). None of this was a big deal until saturday night. Im on service bar doing what i do best (grouping drinks efficiently, laying out glassware first and building multiple cocktails in tins) when one of the bartenders comes over and tells me ""just build one cocktail at a time"" in a very snippy way to which i responded ""is that a serious statement? I have sub 1 minute ticket times. I know how to run a service bar thank you"". I very much know what Im doing and have very high standards. I dont need my hand held. She also watches over me asking what im doing as I make specialty cocktails outside of the menu for guests with specific tastes (which they all love btw). Any one else ever dealt with this kind of thing? Im very nice and keep my ego in check but at some point i feel you have to kind of check their attitude as professionally as possible.

They said they went through an El Nino.  I wish i was told this before me and 6 other family members flew there and spent 5 nights at a 5,000 per room resort.

6u6t5m,RWBY,Jaune Arc Potato.,"So this is a bit of an epiphany at work today about Jaune and where he's gonna go. I think.<lb> Anyways I was thinking about Jaunes emblem when I remembered reading that it's not actually 2 crescent moons but a rainbow, this is confirmed in the Volume 1 Directors Commentary Jaunedice. <lb><lb>How many colours are there in a rainbow? 7. <lb><lb>how many sisters does he have? 7. <lb><lb>Basically I think each sister is gonna have a colour of the rainbow to represent them, but it actually gets slightly deeper then that. See Jaune is based off of Joan of arc, a Roman Catholic saint who had angels and saints speak to her and guide her on her crusades, in Tobit 12:15 of the roman catholic faith this is said ""I am Raphael, one of the SEVEN angels who stand and serve before the Glory of the Lord."" not only is each of Jaunes sisters going to be a colour of the rainbow, but represent one of these seven angels, the three oldest probably going to be Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael or some similar take on the name. <lb><lb>This is further added to the fact that all the named Arcangels are male BUT, Jaune is the male counter part to Joan so it makes sense for the angels genders to be switched as well. So what is the take away from this. This is where some leeway may be needed, see Joan was visited by Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, only one of which was actually an angel and I can't think of who the other 2 saints might be. My theory is that Jaune and his sisters aren't actually related and that they were placed with Jaune to be his protectors and guide him through life and just said they were his sisters to keep suspicions away. Why protect him you ask? Because he's the decedent of the king of vale (a popular theory already) now what importance this holds is still to be seen. If anyone wants to add to this feel free too.<lb><lb>Joan of arc as a military leader wasn't really why she was such a big deal it was actually the moral boost she gave to everyone around her. With her there they were protected by god, providence said they would win and that's why she was so impact-full in many battles. Jaune's thing may be similar where he, as the king of vales decedent, may be a moral boost to others he's with or maybe his semblance, as we know it's already somehow protective, can be given to others and and protect them as well, that would give me a moral boost.<lb><lb>Edit: Formatting <lb><lb>Edit: had another epiphany as I uploaded this.",0.0020300567,6.5379464e-07,0.00027608656,1.0469239e-06,4.4181397e-05,1.7947848e-05

I suspected my T was low due to my lack of interest in everything, including women. I was content staring at the wall and never leaving the house (i work from home).<lb><lb><lb>I found a local ""male clinic"" and setup an appointment. I was susprised at how easy it was to get a script. I filled out a few papers, had a quick talk with a doctor and they gave me my first shot within 45 minutes of getting there (before the lab results). I got the feeling they would give it to just about anyone that walks in. In addtion, they set me up on a ""program"" where if stay with them for x amount of time, they will not charge me a cancelation fee for leaving the program. Honestly, it kind of felt like i was buying a used car. Anyway, i'm happy I got a script, it was strange though. <lb><lb><lb>They started me on 175mg of Cynionate. It's a weekly injection that is shipped in the mail. The syringe also has some Anastrozole in it as an estergen blocker. The process is painless, I just give myself a quick shot in the thigh once a week. <lb><lb><lb>Results are the following:<lb>When I started my testosterone level was at 365. It's now at 768. Other levels as of today are: SHBG=35, PSA=0.6, Estrogen=13.5 and Hematocrit=48.5. <lb><lb>I only go to the gym about once a week but I noticed an increase in strength right away. Maybe a 10% gain after a couple days. Also, I'm barely sore the next day.

I've been this weight before but the difference is that on TRT it's more of a manly weight. It's hard to explain but think of it as skinny-fat vs just fat. Anyway, I need to get started with the cardio.<lb><lb>I have seen an increase in aggression but it's not at the level if ""roid rage"".

7b390d,PFSENSE,OpenVPN + HDHomeRun,"I'm new to pfSense and have limited networking knowledge. I've searched and read several threads on here and on the pfSense forums concerning the use of OpenVPN with HDHomeRun tv network tuners. It seems like no one has a good answer or guide on how to do this successfully. Each thread leaves more questions than answers. I think I've only seen a couple posts from people who said they were able to do it using OpenVPN/TAP, but I need to know if my additional configuration requirements will work as well.<lb><lb>HDHomeRun uses UPnP (SSDP Multicast), so it expects you to be on the same LAN in order for it to work. I currently have my main house where the HDHR tuner is located and then I have a cottage where I'd like to access the HDHR from when I visit. Each house has a 1Gb connection. My idea was to setup pfSense routers on both sides. My main house would act as the OpenVPN server with DynDNS and the cottage would be the client. Currently, both networks are 192.168.1.x. I don't know if that's a problem or not, but obviously I can change it easily.<lb><lb>I use a Shield Android TV device at the cottage for Netflix, Hulu, etc. However, I don't want to pass the traffic from these apps through the VPN. I only want to use the VPN when I open the HDHomeRun app to access the tuner back at my main house (i.e. 192.168.1.12). In other words, I have to do split tunneling based on destination, not the source. Is this going to be a problem? Will I be facing NAT issues?<lb><lb>I've seen people suggest Avahi or IGMP proxy for accessing the tuners.

4xcjr1,GODZILLA,"A godzilla showerthought: 2014 Godzilla is a hero, shin gojira is a villain.","one thing i noticed about godzilla in terms of the american versions vs the japanese original and shin(as well as all out monsters attack) is that american godzillas tend to be heroic because most of us were exposed to the godzilla who came in and beat up the badguys, from zilla jr (who a lot of people thought redeemed the gino version) to 2014 godzilla, the impression is that godzilla is a hero or the ""good guy"" or just a force of balance and whatnot, but the REAL godzilla started as an antagonist, the king of the monsters was a warning to never forget the horrors of the hiroshima bombings, and later on in all out monsters attack that version of godzilla was a straight up living metaphor for the dead soldiers of japan having their sacrifices forgotten, THAT godzilla always struck me as an attempted reboot because not only was he scary as shit, he was essentially the old godzilla's corpse possessed by the dead or something.<lb><lb>now enter shin gojira and the contrast here is just too obvious to ignore, anno's ""shin"" is a fucking alien abomination, it might as well be a blob of death and curses imitating godzilla because that's the feeling i get whenever i see its split jaw or the tail with a face or just the fact that it reproduces like a tapeworm by breaking itself apart.  <lb><lb>whereas 2014 godzilla is more like a metaphor for how we humans are fucking with nature and godzilla exists to put a stop to that sort of thing as a nature balancing force, in this respect, despite being neutral, most of his presentation makes the big G to be downright noble, he's the king of the monsters, he puts kaiju in their place and prevents them from overpopulating the world because it'll disrupt the environment, he's a force for good, just not ""mankind's"" good as he'd been portrayed in the past, but the greater good.<lb><lb>so in my opinion, we've basically seen the division in how americans and westerners perceive and reimagine godzilla, vs how the real godzilla is reimagined to fit with the firm, harsh message he's meant to carry, westerners carry a message of hope, but with a quiet undertone of warning, japanese carry a heavy handed warning, period. godzilla isn't the good guy, he's what happens when we need a wakeup slap, punishment for our sins, as opposed to legendary godzilla who doesn't care about your sins, just so long as you don't fuck up the world he's protecting.<lb><lb><lb>I just think it's interesting to see how easily the two iterations of godzilla have become polar opposites that carry the same sort of message, truly fascinating.",0.32938766,0.00048569165,0.29705703,0.00061964255,0.044382952,0.011211369

I said I hadn't completed the transaction but would see it when I did, and thank you. I moved on quickly and didn't even look at the earnings for another hour. The tip for that transaction was zeroed out. Now, it is possible that this woman made a mistake on her end, or was mildly sadistic and wanted me to think she had tipped me when she hadn't. But if she was just not planning on tipping me, why say anything at all?<lb><lb>This led me to think about the other tipping issues I've heard on here, and how one person watched a customer close out the transaction with a tip, and the tip still showed as pending. I don't really believe this is intentional - I have had sizable tips on small orders that I would easily have expected to zero out. Why not take those? I suspect that this is a system problem, but it's a problem in their favor. Are they even trying to address it? Are they aware? We have absolutely no transparency to know if the reported earnings are correct. We are completely at Postmates' mercy to know what customers are tipping, and this seems like a recipe for illegally withheld wages.<lb><lb>But how can we address this?

6sxr80,autism,Need Something To Work Towards [Career],"I'll start by saying that I'm on the autism spectrum. I had a late diagnosis and went through much of my life not knowing exactly what I wanted to do career wise. I went through many phases of my life pre-diagnosis (majored in anthropology, had a very deep interest in Japanese music and culture). In addition, after seeing specialists and therapists who helped me get through my diagnosis, I got myself onto better footing. <lb><lb>Two years ago, I moved from the US to Japan in search of a different lifestyle. I should mention that while I'm not bilingual, I speak Japanese well, and can read and write. <lb><lb>I started out teaching English, but earlier this year I was offered a full time position working with kids with disabilities at an NPO in Japan (in their native Japanese language). The majority of the children are between the age of six and twelve, and most are on the autism spectrum. In particular, we have three children who, according to our past teacher, would fit on the level three severity of the DSM V; one is non-verbal, and the other two mainly use echolalial speech. I won't get into other aspects of the business here, this isn't about what goes on at the school (although I really do want to talk about this in depth with someone who will listen to my experience... I need some guidance that I can't get from my co-workers); it's about me. <lb><lb>I only took a few psychology classes in college, and I have no formal training in Autism Spectrum. I'm not an expert, but in Japan, it's not required to hold a relative undergraduate degree to work in this field (half of the staff must have degrees, the other have are not required to). I'm just a full time staff member, my undergraduate degree in anthropology and my past experience and point of view (being a person with ASD) means absolutely nothing here. <lb><lb>Therefore, I need a path to a more solid career, whether in Japan or in the United States. I have some barriers- particularly money. Getting a master's degree at the moment is out of the question since I know I can't afford taking on any debt. But I need something that sets me apart from my other co-workers. <lb><lb>I want to learn something, perhaps a tool that I can use with students, such as PECs or another communication system. In particular, PECs is in English and Japanese, so I believe it's a wise choice (I plan on sending an email asking about registration soon). I'm sure there are other communication systems out there, so I'm looking for recommendations. Again, I don't have the money to advance my degree at the moment, but I am looking for any and all recommendations, including must read scholarly articles on Autism to keep me up to date. I have a very deep calling to make someone's life better. <lb><lb>If you've read my whole post, then I want to thank you. I'll talk freely here about career options- that's what this post is for. <lb><lb>If you genuinely want to hear about my story working with ASD children in Japan, please send me a message. I'm not going to lie, I'm facing a major moral dilemma working here, and therefore, I will only talk about these issues in private.

I pity those who try it but refuse to experience it. It is a ""game"" in a loose sense. Yes, there are some puzzle elements and challenges but it's very mild in that aspect. It's more of an interactive story than a game. It's not just a movie though. It's a story that you can take a part in. Playing it to ""beat"" it or ""win"" is not the right mindset. If you're rushing through every part simply trying to get to the end, you will not get much out of it. I really don't play these types of games. I enjoy hardcore survival games, shooters, RPGs and platformers. When I saw The Witcher 3 on my Steam page, something drew me to it. I watched the video and thought the concept of monster hunting was neat so I decided to give it a try. But I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't want to pay for it since it didn't look like the type of game I would normally enjoy. So I pirated it. A couple hours later I sat stunned at what I just experienced. I immediately went to the store page and purchased the entire game. It's been months since I finished it but every time one of the songs comes up on my Youtube mix (by the way, here's a playlist of the in-game music and licensed songs) I feel a tug at my heart. I'm not really an emotional guy but The Witcher 3 got to me in a way nothing else has. You can laugh if you want, I don't mind. My life is a boring day after day repeat. I have very few reasons to be overly happy, excited, sad .. so to have a game cause this much of an effect on me, it's a strange and wonderful experience. If you haven't played it, I strongly implore you to give it a shot. But don't play it like a game. Wander around. Enjoy the environment, the music, the sounds. Look at things. Make decisions based on what you feel rather than what you think might be logical or lead to a better outcome. Don't just play the game. Experience the game. It's worth your time and the rest of the series is worth your money. I would love to be able to forget the game just so I could play it and experience it for the first time again.",0.0099756885,8.766477e-07,0.00076201285,2.0679472e-06,0.00026567394,4.6951e-05

Has your favorite player ever tossed you a ball during warmups or after the 3rd out of a game? Maybe you got a lucky at the bat boy wasn't feeling particularly stingy that day and tossed you a ball that was pitched in the dirt. How did that make you *feel*? Excited? Well according to current public opinion, *you shouldn't*, you should do what every good adult does *give that ball to the nearest child next to you, bonus points if he or she is crying*. <lb><lb>Why is it like this? I remember the days where catching a foul ball was a badge of honor, a trophy to take home of your barehanded catch assisted by the liquid courage flowing through your veins. Your hand stings, but you don't show it. No, you hold up that ball triumphantly to what can only be described as ""just louder than a golf clap."" You sit down, heart racing with pride, and enjoy the rest of the game with your baseball, showing it off to your new friends around you. <lb><lb>That was before [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzm0nh2Q1ak) happened in 2012.

Now, what this women did was retched and cruel to that cute little girl and her shame is warrented. However, what it did was open up the floodgates for sports casters to hone in adults that catch balls at games. Look at [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i8q_Zw8wRBQ).

However based on my estimation and research, GAB/9 has risen at a *much faster pace*, upwards of *11.75%*. No, Baseball fans haven't gotten more generous, they've become more *fearful*. The fear of becoming the next douchebag to end up on this subreddit or shared on Facebook is not worth that juiced baseball that you risked your hand for at the game. <lb><lb>I project that GAB/9 will continue to trend upward at a faster rate as we continue to glorify people who give baseballs to children seated around them. <lb><lb>*fin*",0.099752374,8.17963e-05,0.0060979347,0.00013869921,0.010598248,0.0040941196

7ybj8c,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,Children and hotels,"***Before I indulge into this story, I want to point out I'm  not parent shaming anyone, and I would never report or tell a manager about anything when people are trying to make a living supporting their children and themselves. If they get ""caught"" and are reprimanded on their own accord, then that's something I have no control over.***<lb><lb>Now, in the hotel I've previously worked in, I had my coworker bring in their young child (about 4-6 years old) in the hotel. The coworker was working with me at the time. Now the child wasn't really an issue, some jumping around and all as normally bored and restless children are. It would also mean the coworker would have to leave the hotel at certain times for about 30 minutes each shift to bring them to whoever would be watching them or school.  They were reprimanded by the hotel (not seriously or formally), but it had happened a couple more times, until the coworker started saying that in general, they are not going to be able to make it to work  if they did not have childcare, and would like a personalized schedule (ex. 9-5 or 8-4 and only thurs-sun even though our standard is 7-3/3-11 and there are no set schedules). I never found out what happened as a quit about 2 weeks later.<lb><lb><lb>The second time I experienced this, my coworker at my new location told me that one of the morning coworkers had their child (3-4)  with them all shift that who broke off the keys on the business center computers.  Management did know about this, but since this hotel has all friends/family working together it did not get reported or discipline.  <lb><lb><lb>Now, again at the new location, the person with me, someone dropped off 2 kids (2/3 &amp; 4-5) and they've been here for about 4 hours. The littlest one is constantly yelling and screaming, and making it so that the coworker is constantly not at the desk and with them. Then there's a point where the coworker keeps going outside (not more than 5 minutes) and the children are now wandering the lobby. <lb><lb><lb>I write this because I have never experienced this in other hotels, or otherwise in any other hotel I worked at. Family would come by and visit, for possibly a minute or two, but both jobs have clauses that no one is to have someone on property that aren't guests at the hotel. However,  I am wondering how other properties deal with friends/family visiting or stay during a working shift. It's just unusual to me, I can't speak on whether it's right or wrong. I just wonder where the line is drawn, or if it's preferential treatment.  For example, it's okay to have my child with me and be away from the desk, however, if my s/o comes in and we chat for a minute, as he picks me up from work, I know it would be a problem. The other person who used to work here, their sister came to drop off food, and brought the brother in law too to fill out an application, the the supervisor flipped and called the GM to complain. However, the same supervisor knows about the kids from the weekend before and knows about the coworker with the kids now, and did not say anything and just laughed and played with the kids (which seems like preferential treatment to me). Plus, no matter what, I don't like anyone being in the public spaces like the business center or in the back office, kids or not. I might be chewed out for this, or called a parent shamer or something, however, I just thought that maybe I am wrong and this is normal hotel behavior, and thought I would share my experiences.<lb>",0.0020037442,1.4119313e-07,0.0001842058,1.0707033e-07,4.0911706e-05,8.083446e-06

4zi736,latterdaysaints,How can we trust spiritual feelings concerning truth?,"Something that I have been struggling to conceptualize for some time now is the reliability of a witness from the holy ghost. Ultimately, it is this witness we must rely on, because other methods for ascertaining truth have their roots in man, not God. However, people from other religions speak of spiritual witnessing and of assurance that they are believing exactly what God wants them to in the same manner we do. This even occurs in harmful religious experience, i.e. suicidal cults like Heaven's Gate. How can we differentiate between whose spiritual experiences are more true than another's?<lb><lb>I know that we are to study things out and we will know in our heart and mind, but which takes priority if they are in conflict?

7no7rv,AstralProjection,My Personal Experience With OBE,"Okay I'll start off by saying I have ""suffered"" from sleep paralysis ever since I was a child. It wasn't until my 20's that I really got into researching it, which eventually led to me reading up on using sleep paralysis to astral project. So after semi-extensive research I decided I would attempt this and from what I had read it was said that it was good to focus on astral projecting prior to going to bed. So I would say out loud as I was trying to fall asleep "" tonight I will astral project, I will have an out of body experience"" but nothing ever came of it. <lb><lb>Fast forward 2-3 years later. I'm sitting on a chair in the living room, I have perfect posture with my head resting against the wall. I end up dozing off listening to late night television. Suddenly I'm paralyzed, the all to familiar feeling I've had for as long as I can remember. Except this time, instead of panicking I'm calm. I know that this is my opportunity. So I try to stand up, as I had read to do this in all of my research and the harder I tried my body vibrated more and more intensely until finally I just woke up. Fuck my life. <lb><lb>Fast forward to the next night. I'm the last one in the office and I've stayed over nearly 3 hours so it's pushing 8pm. I lean back in my office chair and rest my head against the wall, just as I had the night before. Once again I doze off, however this time I came into sleep paralysis with research on the vibrating issue. From this research I learned that if when trying to AP you feel vibrations, be patient and keep trying to get up every few seconds until they subside. Once they subside it should work. <lb><lb>So in my sleep paralysis I try to stand up from my office chair. Vibrations. I wait. The second time I try still vibrations. The third time I try it works. I'm standing in front of the computer in my office. The only thing is that my office is slightly different as there is now a bathroom in my office, and there is a separate screen on the desk that has CCTV of the office and the parking lot. So I'm standing there and I noticed on the CCTV there is an absolute mob storming the building. So I fucking panicked. I ran to the bathroom, that again isn't there IRL (would be nice tho) but when I enter it's not a private one person bathroom in my office, it actually has 2 urinals and 4 stalls. I hear my office door being kicked down (now I'm freaking tf out) there I am at the farthest wall of the bathroom up against the wall and the mob rushes in and absolutely no BS they stab me to (what seems like) death with those cheap white metal curtain rods. <lb><lb>Instead of waking up, I sort of respawn. There I am, standing right back in front of the computer, with the CCTV, mob storming through the parking lot towards the building. This time I'm ready. I run to the bathroom, sling open the stall door and climb up on the toilet. I'm reaching up to the ceiling tile to try and push it in and over so I can climb up there. As I'm going to push it the bathroom door opens. But I don't hear a mob no screaming or anything. I step down off the toilet and poke my head out and instead of a mob it's just a lady and she's extended her arm out to me and in her hand is a bagged lunch. I grab the bag and I wake up. <lb><lb>So I don't know if I just went from sleep paralysis to just dreaming or what. I read afterwards that you can have bad OBE experiences ( I always assumed you only had normal/good ones). I haven't really had sleep paralysis since but I'd love to try again. <lb><lb>SN: it's probably worth mentioning, just to get some opinions, that in my teen years I once went into sleep paralysis and this black mass hovered over me and I could physically see it draining energy from my sleeping body.

7empp9,PCOS,Not willing to see it as PCOS,"Hi, My dr (dermatologist) recently expressed the desire for me to get testing done to determine if I have pcos because I have hair on my ass, acne, and I am overweight.

I have zero issues with pms or non-functional cramping and my obgyn has yet to feel it necessary to test for PCOS. The Dr who requested this was a dermatologist. The hair on my butt has been there since I was a teen, and I've never had an influx of hair growth, it's just about the same level. My mother comes from an Italian heritage, and also grew body hair. I have acne and I am overweight but I am still resistant to the idea that I need to do this testing. I just feel that my focus and effort should be on eating healthy and exercising before going through a bunch of stressful tests and possible treatments. If I am still struggling in a year I'm open to the testing, but I'll be damned to be misdiagnosed and treated to screw up my body more when I should start by focusing on diet and life style.

However, some problems when forcing:  I cant seem  to focus on forcing when I actually get in the wonderland, and I get sidetracked very fast. I try to talk to her about whatever pops into my head every day, but I feel like i might just be talking into nothingness instead of directing it at her. And visualization is hard!! Even on really good days in the wonderland, I can barely see her completely.  Also, when I'm in my forcing position, sometimes around 25 minutes in I get so uncomfortable i have to stop. And I feel like i should be forcing a LOT more, seeing as how I usually play games most of the day, and I end up procrastinating and doing not as much as I wanted (I also live with my large family still so i cant get quiet whenever I want so that doesnt help.)

7ttzte,PvZHeroes,The State of This Game,"I don’t know about you guys but I just took a peek at some of these upcoming nerfs/buffs and I gotta say...I don’t think Popcap really thinks about how these changes effect gameplay on the zombie side that much. <lb><lb>ETT now costs 2 instead of 1? Stompadon cost 4? Oh wow you made Abracadaver have 2 health instead of 1? How does that help it’s survivability? It still is taken out by 128 plants (I counted) if it gets fronted. So what’s the point of playing something that’s supposed to hit the hero if it won’t survive long enough to do that, or do it more than once? Medulla Nebula giving only 2 brains? There’s no profit from that so what’s the point?! Nebula helped compete with the insane sun production of sunflowers on the plant side. <lb><lb>Why is it that the zombies always catch these nerfs? All the things that they are adding on the plant side are game changing, DISASTROUS things for the zombies to deal with. (Like a 1 cost that bounces anything it does damage to?! WTF?!) giving every plant strikethrough on turn 4 is dangerous and let’s not act like it isn’t. <lb><lb>But my point of stating all this is to say that the game is already at a point where it’s less fun to play than its ever been. It is starting to feel like there’s no point playing your favorite decks because no matter what you do you won’t win unless you play Stompadon decks. And the answer to that isn’t to make the one kind of decks that work in the meta worse, it’s to make all the other kind of decks better. <lb><lb>I don’t see things getting better with the introduction of Set 4 for zombies. I think that the game is becoming more and more one sided and sadly one of my favorite games will drive everyone away. <lb><lb>How are any other Zombie Hero players feeling?

5gpg4i,harrypotter,Were Dementors once human? Theory,"To give a bit of backstory, Dementors were first discovered after the unveiling of Azkaban, after the death of Ekrizdis. Ekrizdis was from what I have read a sort of introvert dark wizard that lured sailor muggles onto his fortress-island in the North Sea (Siren much?), which had a next level concealment charm on it. In this way, he was able to remain undetected in his fortress from the ministry of magic. After his (natural?) death, the concealment charm wore off, allowing the previously uncharted piece of land to be seen and investigated by the ministry of magic. What they found there was not discussed but it was said the sizeable horde was permitted to stay as guards for the prison of Azkaban as assigned by the ministry of magic.<lb><lb>Now the backstory is over I can now begin to discuss my theory. My theory is that the Dementors are actually the tortured muggle sailors' remains, as I will now begin to convince you. We know from the HP universe that wizards can come back as ghosts, giving them a life after death. This, according to Nearly-Headless Nick, is due to a wizard’s fear of death prior to their demise. Ghosts cannot die (again), as, other than taking an intangible form, we know that during the Chamber of Secrets, Nearly-Headless Nick looks at the basilisk's eyes and is only petrified, where this killed Moaning Myrtle as a human.<lb><lb>The Dementors are seen as human-like creatures with no eyes, decay-like skin and bony hands. They are cloaked; they can fly and have no soul. ""Its body is greyed and decayed looking, like a decomposing corpse"" ~ http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor. Lastly, Dementors are 3 metres in height. The lack of eyes could be because the insane Ekrizdis removed them during his torturing, the decaying skin would be due to the fact he tortured them to the point of death, the lack of soul would be due to a method of extraction practiced by Ekrizdis and the increase in height would be due to a torture device known in England in 1447 as The Rack (this lines up perfectly with the life of Ekrizdis who was around during the 15th century). <lb><lb>It is also known that death by a dementor’s kiss prevents the wizard from turning into a ghost, as they have no soul. However, dementors can multiply by feeding off human despair.<lb><lb>Lastly, like ghosts, dementors cannot die. This leads me to believe that dementors and ghosts are similar (after all my comparisons) and is this because; when someone fears death and dies they become a ghost, but, when someone wishes to die (after immense torture) and has no soul, do they become a dementor?<lb><lb>I would be interested to see everyone’s thoughts on this and sorry for the long post!",0.014180437,1.1329048e-05,0.000997869,0.00018097855,0.00062531093,0.0005982045

(Like an option comes up to either choose to fight or go to the counselor) <lb>7. Shouldn’t a student get in way more trouble for “falsely” telling a teacher/cop someone died? (Like suspended or detention) <lb>8. Will there be a detention option? Like the counselor either gives you a warning, gives you detention, or expels you. For detention it could take away the ability to do anything at night since you would have to go straight to bed once you got home that late. After school ends or the player tries to go home, there could be a little cut scene of Yandere sitting in the back of the classroom (writing Senpai &lt;3 in her notes maybe) while delinquents throw paper airplanes and stuff in front of her. <lb>9. Some students could do their homework during breaks for a more lively atmosphere. <lb>10. Ryuto’s bandana thing is pretty strange, couldn’t he lose his earbuds or something? (and maybe not talk about his life force draining away) Or unless it’s an anime stereotype I don’t know about. <lb>11. The male delinquents and  Ryuto’s hair is VERY tall. Could you make them a bit flatter? (I know anime hair is dramatic but this is a little extreme) <lb>12. I don’t think cowards should help tackle you because they have the persona of having no self confidence when it comes to defending themselves. <lb>13. I don’t think Musume/ her group or Kizana should help tackle you because I feel like they wouldn’t want to put themselves at risk like that. They would want someone else to do the dirty work. <lb>14.

6udo8f,TheWire,Did the Bunk and Miss Anna ever sleep together? (Spoilers),"Now before you think I'm about to go into some really random and obscure fan-fic story, bear with me here. I know it's not uncommon for shows, especially those with casts as extensive as the Wire, to cast actors in one-off throwaway roles, and then re-cast them as different, sometimes recurring characters later on. So with that caveat in mind:<lb><lb>In the 8th episode of season 1 (""Lessons""), Bunk and McNulty are tensely sharing a drink together after Jimmy convinces Bunk to lie to Ray Cole about Omar's involvement in Stinkum's shooting. Rather than continue to drink with his partner Jimmy gives Bunk money for more drinks and starts to leave, but not before Bunk has spotted [this evening's amorous conquest at the end of the bar](http://i.imgur.com/PGgQ6UE.jpg). As Jimmy walks out Bunk tells him to ""Call Nadine and tell her I caught one and I'm out on the street.""<lb><lb>Flash forward a few minutes later and Jimmy's awoken by a phone call from a stranger. He arrives at what turns out to be the woman's apartment after ""This crazy bastard"" (Bunk) has apparently set off her smoke alarm twice. Jimmy enters her bathroom and finds Bunk asleep on the toilet in a pink robe, cigar hanging out of his mouth, and his clothes in a pile in the bathtub, half burned in an attempt to eliminate the ""trace evidence"" (""Hair, fibers, and pussy, man. You smell pussy? I don't smell no pussy no more."")<lb><lb>[You can view the whole thing here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGA7wAj87Qc)<lb><lb>Jumping ahead to season 4, we're introduced to Miss Anna, the foster mother of Randy Wagstaff, an enterprising young boy trying to navigate his way through Edward J. Tilghman Middle School while the life of the streets unfolds right outside Miss Anna's row-house door. [Miss Anna is one of the few people in Randy's life who instills some discipline](http://i.imgur.com/wKwjnyw.jpg), but after their house is fire bombed, Miss Anna is hospitalized, and despite Sgt. Carver's best efforts Randy is eventually sent to a group home.<lb><lb>So what would lead me to believe these two characters hooked up and had some drunken, most likely disoriented (on Bunk's end particularly) coitus? Well, nothing really. For starters, when Jimmy arrives to pick up Bunk in ""Lessons"", [he arrives at an enclosed apartment structure](http://i.imgur.com/7kAWyy5.jpg), not a typical [Baltimore row-house](http://i.imgur.com/2GtGir6.jpg). People move, of course, but what's more likely, as I say at the top, that [actress Denise Hart](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2958837/) was simply cast early in the series to play the character of the woman who catches Bunk's eye in the bar, and then later was cast to portray Miss Anna on a more recurring basis. This was purely a coincidence, and it's extremely unlikely David Simon actually intended for Bunk to have slept with Miss Anna.<lb><lb>When you've watched this series as many times as me, you catch little details like this, I suppose.

7icblm,Drama,Carl Jung on the culture of the Amerimutt,"&gt;Another thing that struck me [in the American] was the great influence of the Negro, a psychological influence naturally, not due to the mixing of blood. The emotional way an American expresses himself, especially the way he laughs, can best be studied in the illustrated supplements of the American papers; the inimitable Teddy Roosevelt laugh is found in its primordial form in the American Negro. The peculiar walk with loose joints, or the swinging of the hips so frequently observed in Americans, also comes from the Negro.[3] American music draws its main inspiration from the Negro, and so does the dance. The expression of religious feeling, the revival meetings, the Holy Rollers and other abnormalities are strongly influenced by the Negro. The vivacity of the average American, which shows itself not only at baseball games but quite particularly in his extraordinary love of talking – the ceaseless gabble of American papers is an eloquent example of this – is scarcely to be derived from his Germanic forefathers, but is far more like the chattering of a Negro village. The almost total lack of privacy and the all-devouring mass sociability remind one of primitive life in open huts, where there is complete identity with all members of the tribe. <lb><lb>-Carl Jung",0.031978045,1.8316423e-06,0.00044732628,2.8546303e-06,0.0008899918,0.0023825262
5z5snw,Rapekink,Rape didn't go well at all. :(,"So as mentioned in my older posts I was going to ask a guy to rape me a couple days ago. I figured I should update on what happened after a kind Redditor messaged me to make sure that I was alright after not posting for a couple days. So, a little background on me first. As my user name suggests I travel a lot. I am currently living in Bogotá, Colombia. Bogotá is a town of over 8 million people and some day is the most dangerous city in Colombia (an already not so safe country if you do things the wrong way). While none of this normally bothers me (in fact I love Colombia and want to move here for good), I do take precautions like not going outside after 10pm with out a guy with me. Some of my girl friends here have been mugged, stabbed, and kidnapped for a couple days to empty her and her friend's bank account. <lb><lb><lb>So my friend that I have been hooking up with here invited me over to his friend's house for a night of heavy drinking and then said that I could stay the night at his place since It takes about 45 minutes by taxi to get from the center (where I live) to the north (where he and his friend live).  Perfect!! I can easily bait this guy I trust into raping me or I can just ask in a situation like that. My phone is broken so for every ~4 times I touch the screen I have to lock and unlock it again so the screen will work. Because of this I had him order me an uber. My uber shows up and takes me to a building on the other side of town (the north). Normally my friend is waiting for me outside when my uber shows up anywhere but he wasn't this time so I ask the driver ""¿es este el edificio correcto?"" He assures me that yes, it is the correct building. It was about midnight at this time and as the driver drove away I realized how short my summer dress was and maybe I should have chose not to wear heals. I was dressed provocatively by the United States standards let alone Colombian standards. <lb><lb><lb>I stood outside trying to get my phone to work so I could hopefully find an open wifi network and contact my friend but I couldn't get my phone to work at all. After about 5 minutes I walked up to the door and a security guard opened a small window to talk with me. I explained to him what happened and who I was looking for. He didn't know anyone by that name that lived there. He couldn't let me inside. He couldn't call a taxi for me. I walked to the next building and did the same with the same answers. I did it again and again and again. <lb><lb><lb>At this point I noticed that a man was watching me (much too old to be the friend I was looking for). As I walked past him up the stairs to another apartment to talk with the security guard he grabbed my arm hard. I don't know what he wanted or if he was even going to do anything to me but instinct took over and I punched in the ear as hard as I could. He yelled out and let go of me for a second and I ran up to the door almost crying begging for the guard to let me in. The man I punched ran off when seeing the guard and get this, the guard wouldn't let me in. He did use his cell to call me a taxi though. I got home and messaged my friend. Turns out the uber didn't drop me off at the right place?<lb><lb><lb>So, I didn't get raped but I did punch a guy in the face out of instinct!

7ya1it,oaklandraiders,There is no better game for week 1 than Kansas City at Oakland on MNF,"Let’s flash back to 1998. Charles Woodson just got drafted and the Raiders signed the Red headed bastard himself, Jon Gruden. Gruden’s first Game came on SNF against Kansas City. KC has just gotten stiffed in the playoffs by the broncos and took out their frustrations all day on Jeff George. A guy by the name of Derrick Thomas got 6. Turns out he was pretty good. <lb><lb>In 99, Gruden had his first shot of redemption in week 17. The Chiefs were 9-6 and needed a win to get the AFC West. Chiefs were up 17-0 and then a blocked Daniel pope punt lead to a TD. This lead to the Raiders taking the Chiefs to the limit. In OT, it was Joe Nedney that sealed the deal with a FG. KC was knocked out and Jon Gruden had led his team to victory, something the Raiders simply didn’t do during the 90s at arrowhead. <lb><lb>Gruden then rose to the top with former chiefs QB Rich Gannon and led the Raiders to an afc title game. He was then traded to The Bucs in a blockbuster trade. Gruden would have the last laugh and beat the Raiders in 2002 in the SB. <lb><lb>The Chiefs simply couldn’t win against Gruden after he won in 99. He swept the Chiefs in 2000 and 01 and beat the Chiefs in 04 and 08 as the coach of the Bucs. If there is anyone that could start off the season right, it would be Gruden vs the Chiefs in Oakland. A great way for the NFL to welcome back Gruden to the coaching spotlight against a team he can beat on his former employer network. A win/win for everyone.

873vh7,Fibromyalgia,I need help bad 23M with Fibro and arthritis,Hello everyone I am stuck and stressed out I’m 23 and just found out what’s wrong with me after 2-3 years of progressively going downhill since my car crash. I’ve been more depressed than ever and have no idea what to do.. I had to quit my job almost a year ago that I had earned a lot of raises from because it was too stressful and I was in pain. I ended up coming back but I only work part time and 400-600 a month less than I used to. I can’t even do the small hours I’m doing now somedays without being the most bitter hateful person ever thy run the place terribly and understaffed. I’m gonna be running out of money soon and have no idea what to do. I joined a gym last week to swim to see if it would help it’s made it worse but probably because I over did it..<lb><lb>I guess my options are move 2-3 hours away to the middle of nowhere with my mom and try to get better but also be terribly depressed from the move and living in that shithole of a house with her pos husband... or I could try getting disability of some sort maybe even good stamps? I make 10 an hour and work 30 hours a week plus going to school. I have already dropped one class this winter semester because it was too much.. nobody understands I’ve been pushing and trying so hard for years now. I have no hope. <lb><lb>Today feels like something is gnawing on my lungs or back again. I’ve tried smoking weed but that can make it worse pain wise. I haven’t tried CBD pills yet however. I think I’m close to getting fired which I’ve never had happen. I’m late I’m grouchy and all for good reasons but my employer wouldn’t understand. My family doctor of 2-3 years gave me the diagnosis of fibro and then my pain management I went back to last week confirmed arthritis from the MRI in my neck and Fibro from a written test thing they had.. I had 24 symptoms checked off. I already spent $250 the last 30 days on medical bills I’m broke and don’t have enough income or any family support money wise. My aunt says I’m too young to have arthritis and shot me down as always. Guess the doctors are just lying to me then huh lol. <lb><lb>Like many of us here we are all venting I just genuinely don’t know what to do.. the chances of getting disability seem super low due to my age. But I truly don’t know what to do. I’d rather not throw away living alone and all the friends I’ve made but it is what it is I’m wayyyy past having hope. My dads just like well you have to keep trying.. what do you think I’ve been doing the last 2 years. I can’t save a dollar to save my life. I don’t see the point in being here anymore my own family doesn’t even understand me. There are somedays I cannot get up to use the bathroom. I’m sure I’ll be fired soon at this rate anyhow. I’m not entirely ready to give up but damn. I take cymbalta everyday for almost half a year if not more but no luck there. My pain management place doesn’t want me on painkillers which I don’t really want either I was on ultram for a year over a year ago and haven’t touched a pill since. However my back has gotten so much worse that I would 100% take one again. <lb><lb>Thanks for reading if you did.

I showed my boyfriend my progress after 5 days and he was shocked at how well i had done. Then he said something that triggered me and caused a rant about how its affected every aspect of my life and my vagina just closed back up within 5 minutes. It is so strange how powerful our minds are but it just proved to me that with positivity and excitement for when you will be cured and can enjoy sex, it can make such a difference. It is such a strange condition, we truly are unique.

Long story short, I think they're now some of my favorite movies. However, as I go through each of the movies, and keep up with the current news about the franchise, several questions come to my mind.<lb><lb>1. The first question involves Alien 3. From what I've already heard and seen of the movie, while it definitely intrigues me, an issue I can't get over is the opening. Again from a glance, while it thematically supports Alien 3, it ruins a lot of the importance of Aliens by killing Bishop, Newt, and Hicks in such a pathetic way. Not to mention, I can't think of a logically explanation without making the characters look like idiots. So with this negativity I'm feeling over the beginning, should I still give Alien 3 a chance, or will it just tick me off?<lb><lb>2. So I bought the Alien Blu Ray the other day and I noticed it has the MU-TH-UR mode for special features. So when I go to look at these special features, it states I need discs five and six. Now I know where these discs come from, the Alien collection, but the thing is, I don't have that. So if I only have Alien on Blu Ray, and not the collection, how do I watch the special features then?<lb><lb>3. Did I jump onto this franchise at the worse time?

What do folks find to be the best all-silver setups and strategies for doing a lot of damage? Something like Natashas and/or Leos with Thunders and Pinatas, and sticking to close-range duels? I don't need to come first (I realize that's not always gonna happen with other players using superior equipment), but I want to give myself the best chance.<lb><lb>2) What do you find to be the most FUN early purchases with gold and WSP. I generally like moving fairly quickly, and dynamic fights at mid- and close-range. For this reason, I mostly run 3 x DB Griffin and 1 Tulumbas Cossack, though I know I might see better results with some slower, heavier hitting robots.

6i55et,AstralProjection,"Either the most lucid dream I've ever had, or I APed","I took a nap today with the intention of APing. <lb><lb>My history with AP: Every time I've ever tried to, the closest I came was lifting my astral arms up and actually looking forward thinking I would see my physical arms because it felt so real but ended up not seeing anything. I could feel myself raising my arms so I assumed it must be my astral arms. Here's the thing, I never know if this is always a lucid dream or an AP. Whenever I've gotten to this point (3times including today) I will then attempt to jump or roll myself out of my body but it always feels like I weigh 20000 pounds. Once I do feel like I've disconnected, I always try and look back at myself, but my vision is always obscured in some way. It's like no matter how far I turn my head, I can't turn it towards my physical body. Usually the AP (or lucid dream?) comes to a stop here then i wake up, then I fall asleep and the same exact process continues about another 10 times.<lb><lb>Today was a little different. I still couldn't see myself, but I was able to throw myself successfully outside of my body and still hold on to consciousness. But I still am not sure if I was dreaming or not because as I walked around my house, things were different than they actually are in the physical realm. I could hear the tv on, but it actually wasn't on. I also couldn't look directly at any screens I knew were there, they just didn't exist and there was blank space where they should be. I could see my husband working on his laptop but I couldn't see the lap top. I went into the kitchen which looked different than my kitchen actually looks. Keep in mind I am 100% aware and in control of all of this the whole time I just don't know if I was lucid dreaming or APing. I saw a laptop sitting on my counter, the only screen I could see but didn't actually exist in the physical world, and I went on it. There was some strange exclusive AP website on it with links to different things I could do while APing. I had my own homepage sign in type of thing and a video played when I accessed it telling me to remember the year 2028 because that is the year my life will change. And also to remember that year if I am ever told another year by a being in my astral state because if any other year is told to me then that being is lying to me. It was all very strange. <lb><lb>I assume if I have to ask if I was truly APing then that means I wasn't. But this time if felt like something really happened.

Honestly the worst thing about this season is the cast/characters. I didn't like any of the rangers! That is what you have to like right from jump street but I just couldn't stand them and that's hard when you have to full them for 32 episodes. I liked how they had 4 different teams of villains, sometimes certain ones get annoy but it was a cool change up. The best episodes was of course ""Once A Ranger"" because they past rangers to come back. (Even though the played all there passed theme music but didn't do it for Adam with MMPR.) The story isn't bad, but it's the lack luster cast that destroys the season. I had fun at times but I was counting down how many episodes I had left.

Here for 3 months now and so far it is not promising, I have no desire to be here long term.<lb><lb><lb>I realise I am lacking in a lot of skills and I have decided to go back to university and get a Masters in a business dicipline. My reasons for doing so are to increase my knowledge and skills set, to gain a recoginised qualification in a business area and to improve my career prospects. Simply put, I do not want to work in support roles any loner. I see no options for progression in this area and it does not challenge or interest me as much as I would like. Also, I think that my language skills and a business qualification will open up a lot of new opportunities for me.<lb><lb><lb>I applied for several courses in Business Management, Project Management and HR and was accepted on to all of them. After a lot of thinking, I decided to decline the offers to the Management courses I had been offered, and instead accept a place on the Masters in Human Resources Management. Mainly because the Management courses were very general and tried to cover too many bases; I felt that a specific qualification would be more useful. I start HR Management in September.<lb><lb><lb>My general plan is to continue my current job to save money, then quit it a week before my Masters starts. Once my Masters starts, I want to apply to part time HR positions. I'll be looking at internships and entry level generalist positions. My resoning is that I need to get some practical experience along side my qualification so that I can find a job in HR more easily once I qualify.<lb><lb>I realise it may seem a little odd to be pursuing a Masters in an area I've never studied or worked in before but I've done a lot of research into the field of HR and I think that it is the business area most suited to me. I genuinely think I will enjoy studying HR and pursuing a career in it. Plus, I no longer want to work in support, and I think that gaining a business qualification will help me move sideways.<lb><lb>I'd love some feedback on my plan or any advice to help me prepare for the Masters I'm about to undertake. How can I prepare myself for this new area of study? Any advice will be much appreciated!<lb><lb>",0.002254849,1.832284e-07,0.00015996865,2.988112e-07,4.555408e-05,6.235327e-06

7uaunx,stepparents,7 yr old not sleeping through the night; What do?,"First of all, I want to thank this community. I don't have a lot of resources or friends to go to in real life. Reading your experience/ advice has made a world of difference already.<lb><lb>That being said, I need some help. My boyfriend and I have recently moved in together and this past weekend was the first weekend his son stayed with us. (Son is 7). I spent the past few weeks cleaning, getting rid of excess clutter, and setting up a room for him in the apartment (the room was previously used as an office). We had a decent weekend together, but he woke us up 5 times a night Friday night and Saturday night for various reasons. He is certainly old enough to sleep through the night, but I think because of the big change he was scared (understandably so), and also BM lets him sleep with her and doesn't enforce strong boundaries when it comes to bedrooms.<lb><lb>The lack of sleep led to all three of us being cranky on Saturday and I think I planned too many activities. I wanted the weekend to be fun and special so we went to Legoland and we were out running around for more than 10 hours. BF and I had finally fallen asleep and a few hours in, were awoken by SS knocking on the door. After BF put him back into the room, I had a small meltdown and this lead to a fight that was just resolved last night between BF and I.<lb><lb>I have two questions. The first one is logistical. What can I do make him feel more comfortable so he will sleep through the night? It's been suggested I get a dream catcher (he has one at home and thinks it helps him not have nightmares) and maybe a comfort item like a stuffed toy. I was even thinking maybe a sound machine might be comforting. BF does a great job of putting him back to sleep and not letting him sleep with us, so we are working on the boundary issue. But what else can I do? He seems to be a bit behind his peers emotionally and I wonder if this is related. <lb><lb>My second question is how to deal with the emotional side to this. I started having serious doubts about being a step parent; my ability to deal with being awoken all night (I had an important meeting on Sunday and a lot of work to do and was not happy running on 3 hours of sleep); my ability to deal with a cranky, whiny, 7 year old who did not seem appreciative of all we did for him all weekend; and even my doubts as to whether or not I want my own bio kids.

6kzr5t,Cuckold,"It's finally happening, and it's everything I thought it would be!","After years of trying to get my wife to fuck other men, it's finally happening. Here's the basic rundown, feel free to ask questions. <lb><lb>I've had a cuckold fantasy for years. My wife had known this, and would play along via dirty talk from time to time, but never wanted to actually meet someone else. She was more interested in me fucking other women from time to time, and of course I was happy to oblige. <lb><lb>6 months ago or so, her libido dropped sharply due to introduction of a new medication, and the cuck fantasies began to be a huge turnoff for her, so she asked that I not mention it during sex anymore. Disappointing, but of course I did what she asked. <lb><lb>That brings us to the past couple weeks. After I lost my job and was having trouble finding another, my wife became very concerned for our financial future. She has a friend (young widow, single mother) who introduced her to the idea of being a sugar baby. For those unaware, it's basically wealthy men who don't have the time or social skills for dating, who will pay money for dates with young, beautiful women. This may or may not include sex, depending on the person. <lb><lb>My wife is incredibly sexy - D cups, mind-blowing ass... Naturally, she's been flooded with offers, mostly from men who are old, unattractive, overweight, etc. She's met up with a couple of these people, which was a big turn-on for me, but she was clearly only doing it for the money. Protection and safety procedures were followed, don't worry. <lb><lb>Then she met this most recent guy. He's young. He's hot. He's a doctor. She is so turned on by this guy, and she hasn't even met up with him yet. They sexted for hours last night (which he's great at... He should probably write erotica or something), while I kneeled in front of her chair and ate her pussy. It was incredible, I can't remember the last time she was that turned on. They're supposed to be meeting up today, and I can't wait. She told me she may let him fill her pussy with cum (she's sterilized, he's clean), then come straight home for me to clean her out. <lb><lb>On top of all this, she's decided she wants to try orgasm control. I haven't cum in 5 days, and she takes every opportunity to tease me, lightly stroking my cock and telling me how it's too bad I can't cum until this weekend. I'm constantly aroused, and my balls ache from lack of release. <lb><lb>Lastly, she's decided this would be the perfect opportunity for me to be fucked by another man. I'm bisexual (bottom, very submissive as you mount have guessed), but never had the opportunity to explore with men. She's had me talking to men on grindr, and I think I've found someone with a big cock (8 inches, uncut, thick) for me to please on Tuesday night. Keep in mind, I'm not allowed to cum - unless, she said, it's from anal simulation only. So I'll be dripping precum, unable to play with myself while I struggle to deepthroat this gorgeous cock... I've never had anything this big in my ass before, only slightly smaller toys, but if it's my only avenue to orgasm then you can bet I'll give it my best shot to take him balls deep. I can't fucking wait. <lb><lb>So there's my story. In two weeks, I've gone from thinking I would never get to fulfill these fantasies, to having virtually all of them become reality, and loving it exactly as much as I imagined. I just need to help her find an ultra-dominant bull who will fuck her crazy while I watch and serve... But after all this, I'm pretty sure we'll get there. <lb><lb>This is all 100% real, but as I'm unverified it will be marked as fiction - I know the drill.
